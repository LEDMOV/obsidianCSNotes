## Packet & Circuit Switching

### What is Packetising?

- Packetising is a process where a large message is divided into smaller, manageable units called packets
    
- Each packet can then be sent individually over the network
    

### Packet formation

- When a message is too large to be sent as a single unit, it's divided into smaller packets
    
- Each packet is typically composed of a header, payload (actual data), and a footer (or trailer)
    

### Use of headers

- Headers are important because they contain information necessary for the packet's delivery
    
- Typical information in a header includes:
    
    - Source **IP address**: identifies the sender of the packet
        
    - Destination IP address: identifies the intended recipient of the packet
        
    - Sequence Number: helps in reassembling the packets back into the original message at the receiving end
        
    - **Protocol**: identifies the transport protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.)
        
    - Packet Length: indicates the size of the packet
        
    - Checksum: a value used for error-checking
        

### Packet transmission

- After being packetised and **encapsulated** with headers (and trailers), packets are transmitted individually across the network
    
- Packets might take different routes to reach their destination
    

### Packet reassembly

- When the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled back into the original message using information in the headers
    

### Packet switching

- Packet switching is a networking communication method that breaks down data (large files, emails) into smaller packets, sends these packets separately along different routes, and then reassembles them at their destination
    

|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|
|Efficient use of network resources as packets can follow different paths to the destination, using more of the available bandwidth|Not ideal for real-time services like video calling or VoIP, which require a steady stream of data without delays|
|More reliable, as if a single packet fails to reach its destination, only that packet needs to be resent, not the entire data stream|Packets can arrive out of order, requiring reassembly and error-checking|
|Lower cost due to shared network resources|Potential for congestion in the network|

### Circuit switching

- Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path is established between two devices for the duration of their conversation (like a phone call), and all packets are sent along the same route
    

|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|
|Ideal for real-time services, with a constant and steady data transmission rate|Less efficient, as resources remain allocated during the whole conversation, even when no data is being sent|
|No delays as a dedicated path is established|It is more costly due to the dedicated line requirement|
|Data arrives in order as it follows the same path|Less flexible and scalable, as adding new devices can be complexx|

### Summary table for Circuit and Packet Switching

||**Packet Switching**|**Circuit Switching**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A mode of data transmission in which a message is broken into several parts sent independently, over whatever route is optimum for each packet, and reassembled at the destination.|A mode of data transmission in which a dedicated communication path is established between two devices through a network for the duration of their conversation.|
|**Data Transmission**|Data is broken into packets and transmitted independently.|Data is transmitted in a continuous stream.|
|**Efficiency**|High efficiency as network resources are shared and used as needed.|Lower efficiency as a dedicated path is maintained even when no data is being transmitted.|
|**Reliability**|More robust against network failures as packets can be rerouted.|Less flexible in handling network failures as the dedicated path, once broken, needs to be re-established.|
|**Scalability**|It is highly scalable as it can accommodate large amounts of data and many users.|Less scalable due to the need for dedicated paths for each communication.|
|**Use Cases**|Best for data that can tolerate some delay, such as emails and web pages.|Ideal for real-time services, like voice calls or video conferencing, that require low latency.|

#### Examiner Tip

- Avoid talking about the speed of data transmission in an answer to a question on packet or circuit switching. This will not get you a mark in the exam and, in some questions, is explicitly stated as not worthy of a mark. It is better to talk about higher bit rates or **bandwidth** (the number of bits sent per second) or the efficiency of the transmission
