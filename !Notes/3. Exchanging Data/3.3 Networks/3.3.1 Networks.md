[[!3.3 Networks]]
## Networks

### What is a Network?

- A network is a set of interconnected devices (such as computers, printers, and servers) designed to share resources, exchange data and communicate with each other
    
- The main purposes of a network are to enable data sharing, resource sharing, communication, and collaboration
    

### Purpose & importance of protocols

- **Network protocols**  define the rules and formats that devices must follow to communicate with each other over the network
    
- They ensure successful and secure data transmission, and help maintain order and efficiency in communications
    
- Examples of protocols include HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP, and SMTP, among others
    

### Understanding the term "standard"

- A standard in a network or any data transfer situation refers to a set of guidelines or frameworks that govern how a task should be performed or how a product should function
    
- Standards ensure compatibility, interoperability, and consistency across different devices and software
    

### Purpose & need for standards in a network

- Standards enable different network devices, regardless of their manufacturer or model, to work together seamlessly
    
- They ensure that data can be correctly interpreted and processed by the receiving device, regardless of where or how it was sent
    
- Standards support network expansion and the integration of new technologies without disrupting existing operations
    
- They foster innovation and competition by providing a common ground for all manufacturers and developers
    

### Common Internet Protocols

|**Protocol**|**Notes**|
|---|---|
|**HTTP**  <br>(HyperText Transfer Protocol)|Primary protocol for transferring web content (text, images, video)  <br>Works as a request-response protocol in a [client-server](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/3-exchanging-data/3-3-networks/client-server-and-peer-to-peer/) computing model|
|**HTTPS**  <br>(HTTP Secure)|A version of HTTP, but with **encryption** for security  <br>Used for secure transactions like online banking and shopping|
|**SMTP**  <br>(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)|The standard for sending email messages between servers  <br>It is also used to send emails from a client to a server for further forwarding|
|**FTP**  <br>(File Transfer Protocol)|Used for transferring files from one host to another over a network  <br>Provides authentication (username and password) and can manage file directories|
|**ARP**  <br>(Address Resolution Protocol)|Translates IP addresses into MAC (Media Access Control) addresses  <br>This ensures that data packets reach the correct device on a network|
|**TCP**  <br>(Transmission Control Protocol)|Part of the main suite of protocols used in the Internet Protocol Suite  <br>Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of packets|
|**UDP**  <br>(User Datagram Protocol)|A simpler message-based connectionless protocol  <br>UDP does not guarantee delivery by disregarding order and error-checking, making it faster|
|**IP**   <br>(Internet Protocol)|Functions mainly by addressing and routing packets of data from the source to the target device|

#### Worked Example

**The internet can be considered an example of a WAN.**  
**The internet uses a set of protocols referred to as the TCP/IP stack. The TCP/IP stack consists of four different layers, each with its own set of protocols.**

**How to answer this question:**

- You need to know what network protocols are and why they are important for network communication:
    
    - They allow us to communicate over a network by ensuring that all communicating parties use the same rules and standards
        
    - Whatever data or signals are sent need to be understood commonly by both the sender and the receiver
        

Answer:  
  
**Example answer that would get full marks:**  
  
Protocols are rules that must be followed to allow communication over a network. They ensure that all devices follow the same rules and standards so that they interpret data and signals in the same way.
