[[!3.3 Networks]]

Key Protocols

|Protocol|Description|
|---|---|
|**HTTP**|Primary protocol for transferring web content.|
|**HTTPS**|Secure version of HTTP, used for secure transactions.|
|**SMTP**|Standard for sending email messages between servers.|
|**FTP**|Used for transferring files over a network.|
|**TCP**|Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of packets.|
|**UDP**|A connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery.|
|**IP**|Responsible for addressing and routing packets of data.|

Key Network Security Threats

- **Hackers**: Individuals who exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to data.
- **Viruses**: Malicious software that replicates itself and can damage systems.
- **Malware**: Software designed to harm or gain unauthorized access, including types like worms, Trojans, and ransomware.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attack that floods a server with requests, causing it to crash.
- **Phishing**: Attempts to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity.

Key Network Hardware

|Device|Description|
|---|---|
|**Modem**|Converts digital signals to analogue for transmission over phone or cable lines.|
|**Router**|Routes data between networks and determines the best path for packets.|
|**Switch**|Connects devices on a network and forwards data only to the intended recipient.|
|**Hub**|Connects multiple devices but broadcasts data to all connections, leading to inefficiencies.|
|**Wireless Access Point (WAP)**|Projects Wi-Fi signals and connects to a wired network.|

Key Concepts in Data Transmission

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Packet Switching**|Breaks data into packets that are sent independently and reassembled at the destination.|
|**Circuit Switching**|Establishes a dedicated path for communication between two devices for the duration of the conversation.|
|**Encapsulation**|The process of wrapping data with protocol information at each layer of the TCP/IP model.|

Facts to Memorize

- TCP/IP stack consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, Link.
- Common Internet Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, FTP, ARP, TCP, UDP, IP.
- IPv4 format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (e.g., 192.168.1.1); IPv6 format: xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx (e.g., 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:6816:4aca).

Reference Information

- TCP/IP is the suite of protocols used for communication over the internet.
- DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses.
- LANs are local networks, while WANs cover larger geographical areas.

Problem-Solving Steps

To explain the importance of protocols in a network:

1. Define what network protocols are.
2. Explain how they ensure communication by standardizing rules.
3. Discuss the implications of not having protocols (e.g., miscommunication).
4. Provide examples of common protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).

Key Terms/Concepts

- **Network**: A set of interconnected devices designed to share resources, exchange data, and communicate.
- **Protocol**: A set of rules and formats that devices must follow to communicate over a network.
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network contained within a small geographical area, typically owned by a single entity.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that connects multiple LANs over a large geographical area.
- **TCP/IP**: A suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
