## Network Hardware

## What Hardware is Needed in a Network?

### Modem

- A modem (**mod**ulator-**dem**odulator) is a device that modulates an analogue carrier signal to **encode digital information** and also demodulates a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information
    
- It **enables a computer to transmit data over telephone or cable lines** by converting digital signals into analogue and vice versa for receiving data
    
- It can be used for **DSL**, cable, or dial-up internet connections
    

### Router

- A router is a network hardware device that routes data from a local area network (LAN) to another network connection - **it joins two networks together**
    
- Routers analyse data packets and determine the best path for the packet to reach its destination
    
- The router can **often feature additional functionalities** such as wireless networking, built-in firewalls for enhanced security, and network switch capabilities
    
- A router being used to connect a LAN to a WAN will have a public **IP address**, which has been assigned to it by an Internet Service Provider
    
- It is this public IP address that other routers use to identify and direct packets to the network
    
- An important role of the router is to analyse data packets and direct them to their destination
    
    - The **header** contains information about the packet
        
    - The **payload** is the actual data being sent
        
    - The IP address of both the sender and intended recipient is stored in the header of the data packet

_**Multiple networks connected by routers, represented by the blue circular objects**_

- If the **data packet** is coming into the LAN, the router will send the data packet to the specific device within its LAN that the packet is meant for
    
- If the packet is being sent from a device within the LAN, it will read the header of the packet to determine the intended destination IP address
    
    - It might have to travel through several routers before it gets to its destination
        
    - Each pass from router to router is called a hop
        
    - It will then forward the packet to its destination
        
- The network access device or ‘home hub’ used in your home network will have a router built into it
    

|**Step**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|1|A router receives incoming data packets from one network and analyses the packet header to determine the destination IP address|
|2|It then looks up the IP address in a routing table (routing table of known networks) to determine the next network where the packet should be sent|
|3|The router then forwards the packet to the appropriate network or device|

- Every router repeats this process the data packet passes through until it reaches its destination
    
- In addition to routing data between networks, routers can also perform other functions such as:
    
    - Assigning IP addresses to devices within the LAN
        
    - Filtering incoming traffic based on certain criteria, such as IP address, port number, or protocol type
        

### Cables

- Cables are the physical paths for data to travel between devices in a network
    
- **Ethernet** cables, like Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6, are common types of network cables used for wired networks. They can transfer data at various speeds (10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps)
    
- Fibre-optic cables use light to transmit data, offering much higher speed and larger data capacity
    

### NIC (Network Interface Card)

- A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component, historically a card inserted into a slot on the motherboard but now more likely to be built into the motherboard, that enables a device to connect to a network
    
- NICs have a built-in ethernet port and can be connected to a network via an ethernet cable
    
- It provides a dedicated, full-time connection to a network, converting the computer's data into a network-friendly format
    
- Every NIC has a unique identifier called a **MAC address**, used to identify the device on the network
    
- The primary function of a NIC is to send and receive data packets between the computer or device and the network
    
- Each network interface card has a unique identifier, which is known as a MAC address, which is created during the manufacturing process
    

### Wireless Access Point (WAP)

- Wireless access points (WAPs) act as a central transmitter and receiver of Wi-Fi signals
    
- WAPs connect to the wired network from a fixed location using Ethernet or Fibre optic cable and project a Wi-Fi signal to a designated area
    
- In a large network, multiple access points are used to provide extensive coverage and handle many connections
    

### Hub

- A hub is a networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network
    
- Hubs are "dumb" devices that pass on anything received on one connection to all other connections
    
- Because all data is sent to all devices, it can lead to network inefficiencies and security issues
    
- Hubs allow multiple other devices to be connected to them

- Hubs are generally much cheaper than switches, but:
    
    - When a hub receives a data packet, it will broadcast it to every device on the network
        
- This creates two potential issues:
    
    - As the information is being broadcast to every device, it will make unnecessary traffic, especially if there are a large number of devices
        
    - As every device will receive the data packet, security may be a concern
        

### Switch

- A network switch is a networking device that connects devices on a computer network and uses packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device
    
- Unlike a hub, a switch only sends data to the device it was intended for, which improves network efficiency
    
- Switches are also used to connect several devices just like a hub; however, rather than sending data packets to all devices on the network, the switch will only send the data to its intended device
    

![switch](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/08/switch.png)

- This is done by each switch having a lookup table  
    

|**Port**|**Mac address**|
|---|---|
|1|DF-42-B2-11-4D-E3|
|2|11-14-F2-1D-C3-C6|
|3|00-4B-17-7C-A2-C9|

- When a switch receives a data packet, it examines the destination MAC address and looks up that address in its lookup table
    
- Once it has found the matching MAC address, it will then forward the data packet to the corresponding port
