[[!3.3 Networks]]

## LAN & WAN

### What is a Local Area Network (LAN)?

- LANs are networks that are contained within a  **small geographical location** 
    
- Typically, **all the hardware used to make a LAN is owned by a single entity**
    
    - This makes them more secure than WANs, which have connections owned by third-party companies
        
- A LAN is a network that is built using hubs and/or switches that connect several devices
    
- It is common for one hub or switch to be connected to a router, which will allow the LAN to connect  to other networks, such as the Internet
    

- A LAN can offer many advantages, such as:
    
    - **Centralised management** - A LAN allows centralised management of updates, backups and software installations
        
    - **Security** - A LAN can secure its devices with the use of firewalls, antivirus software and other security features to prevent unauthorised access
        
    - **File Sharing** and collaboration - A LAN allows users on the network to share resources such as printers and other peripherals. Users of the network can also collaborate and share files and folders
        

- Disadvantages of a LAN include:
    
    - If **hardware fails, the network may not function** properly or even at all
        
    - Networks are more **prone to attacks** than standalone computers
        
    - **Access to data and peripherals can be slow** depending on network traffic when compared to locally stored data and locally connected peripherals
        
    - **Maintenance** - LAN networks require maintenance to ensure that software is up to date. Upgrades and backups can be costly
        

### What is a Wide Area Network (WAN)?

- WANs are collections of LANs spread over a large geographical area
    
    - E.g. a company may connect two LANs between two cities to create a WAN
        
    - The individual LANs are usually connected via third-party connections 
        
    - e.g. leased lines from ISPs or Telecommunications companies
        

#### Worked Example

**The internet can be considered an example of a WAN.**

**Describe what is meant by the term ‘WAN’.**

**How to answer this question:**

- For 2 marks, you need to make 2 points about what a WAN is
    
- Since the question uses WAN as an acronym, it is a good idea to show you know what WAN stands for
    

Answer:

**Example answer that would get full marks:**

A WAN (short for Wide Area Network) is a network spread over a large geographical area such as a country.

#### Worked Example

**A coffee company has coffee shops located across the country. Each shop has its own Local Area Network (LAN)**

**The company wants to connect the shops in a Wide Area Network (WAN).**

**Describe two characteristics of a LAN.**                 

    2 marks

**How to answer this question:**

- You need to make 2 points about how a LAN is different from a WAN:
    
    - LANs cover a small geographical area
        
    - The hardware that makes up the LAN is typically owned by one company
        
    - For this reason, a LAN is considered to be more secure than a WAN
        

Answer:

**Example answer that would get full marks:**

LANs are considered more secure than WANs since the LAN's connections are owned by the organisation that owns the LAN.
