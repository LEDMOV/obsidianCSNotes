## TCP/IP

### What is Protocol layering & the TCP/IP stack?

- Protocol layering is the way network **protocols** are divided into layers, each of which performs specific functions
    
- This allows for modular design, simplifies troubleshooting, and promotes interoperability
    
- This means that protocols that operate at the network layer can be altered independently of application layer protocols
    
- TCP/IP stack is the suite of protocols that the internet is based on
    
- Network protocols are organised into layers to handle different aspects of communication tasks
    

### Why use Layering?

- Modularity: By breaking the complex process of networking into more manageable layers, it's easier to design, implement, and troubleshoot networks
    
- **Interoperability**: Layering allows different technologies to work together seamlessly. E.g. an application can send data to another application on a different device without knowing the details of how the network structure in between works
    
- Ease of Updates: With a layered model, changes can be made to one layer without affecting others. This makes updates and improvements easier to implement
    
- Specialisation: Each layer can be specialised to perform its functions without worrying about the specifics of other layers. This allows for more effective and efficient design
    

### The 4 layer TCP/IP model

- TCP/IP, or the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet
    
- This model splits the various protocols into four layers:
    
    - Application
        
    - Transport
        
    - Internet
        
    - Link
        

#### Application layer

- This is the layer where the communication process begins
    
- The application layer interacts directly with software applications, such as web browsers and email clients
    
- The application layer prepares data for transmission over the network by converting it into a format that can be sent and received over the network (known as encapsulation)
    

#### Transport layer

- The transport layer receives data from the application layer
    
- The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between the source and destination
    
- The transport layer breaks the data it receives down into smaller units called packets
    
- Each packet is assigned a port number (so the data can be reassembled in the correct order at the destination)
    
- Each packet is also labelled with a header containing information (e.g. the packet number) 
    

#### Internet layer

- The internet layer receives packets from the transport layer
    
- It adds a header to each packet, including the sender's **IP address** and the receiver's IP address
    
- The internet layer is responsible for routing each packet across the network using the IP addresses in the headers
    

#### Link layer

- Also known as the network interface layer
    
- The link layer receives packets from the Internet layer and prepares them for transmission over the physical network
    
- The link layer translates the digital packets into an electrical, optical, or wireless signal that can be sent over the network
    
- Once the signal reaches the receiving end, the network layer translates it back into digital packets

_**TCP/IP stack layers**_

### Key points

- At each layer of the TCP/IP model, specific tasks are performed to prepare data for transmission over the network
    
- The process is reversed at the receiving end, with each layer removing its specific header and performing its specific tasks to get the data back into a format that the receiving application can use
    

### Data transmission over the Internet

- The Internet relies on [packet-switched](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/3-exchanging-data/3-3-networks/packet-and-circuit-switching/#:~:text=are%20reassembled%20correctly-,Packet%20Switching,-Packet%20switching%20is) networks, where data is broken down into packets, each of which can take its own route to the destination
    
- Packets are units of data. They are small and easier to manage
    
- Each packet contains:
    
    - The payload (the data)
        
    - A header (with metadata like source and destination IP addresses)
        
    - A footer (to signify the end of the packet)
        

### IP addresses

- An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network
    
- IP addresses are used to deliver packets to the correct destination
    
- Two versions are in use: IPv4 (e.g. 104.22.74.202) and IPv6 (e.g. 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:6816:4aca)
    

#### Worked Example

**A company releases an Internet connected fridge. Users can email messages to the fridge and it puts them on its display.**

**The fridge uses the TCP/IP stack.**  
**Explain what is meant by the term ‘TCP/IP stack’.**

 3 marks

**How to answer this question:**

- You need to expand the acronym ‘TCP/IP’ to show the examiner you know what it stands for
    
- You need to explain what network protocols are and that they are organised into various layers
    
- You need to describe what happens to the data as it is passed from one layer to the next
    

Answer:

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

The TCP/IP stack stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol and refers to a set of layered protocols (rules) used for communicating across the Internet. Each protocol belongs to one of four different layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the internet layer and the network layer. Each layer, starting at the application layer, takes data and encapsulates it before passing it to the next layer.
