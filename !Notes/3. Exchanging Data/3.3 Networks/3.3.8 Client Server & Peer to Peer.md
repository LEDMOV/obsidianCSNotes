[[!3.3 Networks]]

## Client-Server

### What is a Client-Server Network?

- Powerful and reliable ‘server’ computers control the network and ‘serve’ the clients with services such as files, email, web access, etc.
    
- Clients connect to the servers to access network services
    
- In this setup, the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the clients
    

|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|
|Easier central management|Single point of failure -  if the server goes down, services could be unavailable|
|Scalability: new clients can be added easily|It can be expensive to set up and maintain - often need dedicated teams of people to maintain them|
|Higher reliability as resources are managed centrally||

- Use case: larger organisations where centralised control is needed, and reliability and security are paramount

#### When to use a client-server network

- The choice between client-server and peer-to-peer depends on the specific needs and resources of the network in question
    
- Security, cost, ease of setup, and maintenance requirements should be considered
    

## Peer-to-Peer

### What is a Peer-to-Peer Network?

- This is the simplest type of network
    
- In this setup, all **computers in the network share equal responsibility,** and there is no central server
    
- All **machines have equal status**
    
- Each machine is the responsibility of that machine’s user in terms of security, backup, etc.
    
- **Data is often spread around the network,** with each user being responsible for their data
    

|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|
|Easy to set up and less expensive than client-server as no administrative staff are needed|Lack of central control can lead to security issues and vulnerabilities|
|No dependency on a central server|Not suitable for large networks as it can have performance issues|
|Data can be shared directly between systems without the need for a central server||

- Use cases: home networks, small businesses, or for specific applications like file sharing
