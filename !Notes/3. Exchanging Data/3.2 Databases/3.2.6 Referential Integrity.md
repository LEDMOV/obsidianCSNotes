## Referential Integrity

### What is Referential Integrity?

- Ensures **consistency** between related tables in a relational database
    
- Maintains valid **relationships** between **primary** and **foreign** keys
    
- There should not be foreign keys for which a matching primary key in the linked table does not exist
    
- **Foreign key constraints**
    
    - Value in a foreign key field must either:
        
        - Match a primary key value in the related table, or
            
        - Be **null** (if allowed)
            
    - Enforce **referential integrity**
        
    - Rules:
        
- **Cascade actions**
    
    - **CASCADE**: automatically makes changes to related records
        
    - **SET NULL**: sets foreign key value to null in related records
        
    - **SET DEFAULT**: sets foreign key value to its default in related records
        
    - **NO ACTION/RESTRICT**: prevents changes if related records exist
        
    - Update or delete actions will take effect everywhere in the database automatically
        
    - Types:
        

**Benefits and Drawbacks of Referential Integrity**

|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|
|Ensures data consistency and accuracy|Can impact performance due to additional checks|
|Prevents orphaned records|May require additional planning and design|

- Maintaining **referential integrity**
    
    - Use database management systems (DBMS) with **built-in support**
        
    - Implement triggers to **enforce** custom referential integrity rules
        
    - Regularly **validate** and clean up data to ensure **consistency**
        

#### Worked Example

**A hotel uses a computer system to keep track of room bookings. The hotel staff are able to query a database to discover which rooms are booked or which rooms are free**

**The hotel booking database enforces referential integrity.**

**Explain what is meant by the term ‘referential integrity’ and how this could potentially be broken**

**[2]**

  
**Answer**:

Database/relationships are consistent and each foreign key links to an existing/valid primary key **[1]**  
If a primary key is deleted, foreign keys that link to it are no longer valid so they should also be deleted - this is known as a cascaded delete **[1]**
