[[!3.2 Databases]]

## Entity Relationship Types

### What is an Entity?

- An **entity** in something worthy of capturing and storing data about e.g. _students, orders, products, courses, customers_
    
- Entities become tables in a **relational database**
    
- Relational databases store different entities in **separate tables**. Linking tables depends on the relationships between entities.
    
- There are 3 types of (sometimes called degrees of) **relationships:**
    
    - **One to one**
        
    - **One to many**
        
    - **Many to many**
        
- Imagine a company has 
    
    - A table of products
        
    - A table of customers
        
    - A table of the orders the customers have made
        
- What is the **relationship** between a customer and an order?
    
    - **One** customer can make multiple (**many**) orders
        
    - But each order relates to a specific (**one**) customer
        
    - So the relationship between customer and order is **one to many**
        
- Now consider the **relationship** between a product and an order
    
    - An order could have more than one (**many**) products on it
        
    - A product could be on more than one (**many**) order
        
    - So the **relationship** between order and product is **many to many**
        
- **One to one** relationships also exist but are not very common in databases
    

## Drawing Entity Relationship Diagrams

- **Entity Relationship Diagrams** (**ERDs**) are simple diagrams that represent the entities (tables) that will be in a database and the relationships between these entities
    
- The entities are drawn as boxes with the **entity** name in
    
- The relationships are drawn in as what is known as ‘crow’s feet notation’
    
- This is how to draw the relationships in the exam:

- The names of the entities would go inside the boxes
    

#### Examiner Tip

These diagrams are simple but tell us some important things about the database:

- The names of all the tables
    
- Which tables will have a foreign key - when an entity has a ‘many’ relationship against it that means it will have a foreign key in it that links to the primary key of the connected entity
    

#### Worked Example

**An insurance company's offices have a large number of black and white printers**

**The company's technicians keep accurate records of the printers in the building, and the quantity of toner cartridges in stock, in a flat file database. An extract of the database is shown:**

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Printer Model**|**Location**|**Notes**|**Cartridge Code**|**Quantity in stock**|**Re-order URL**|
|LasPrint LP753|office 3||LP-7XB|12|www.megacheapprint.com/toner / LP-7XB|
|LasPrint LP710|office 6|drum replaced|LP-7XB|12|www.megacheapprint.com / toner / LP-7XB|
|Zodiac ZN217|reception||Zod17|4|www.zodiaclaserprinting.com / shop / Z17|
|Zodiac ZN217|conference Room 2|had to add RAM|Zod17|4|www.megacheapprint.com / toner / LP-7XB|
|LasPrint LP753|office 8||LP-7XB|12|www.megacheapprint.com / toner / LP-7XB|

**A relational database is created with three tables:**

- **PrinterModel: this stores all the data about each model of printer**
    
- **PrinterInstance: this stores the data about each individual printer in the building**
    
- **Cartridge: this stores information about the toner cartridges**
    

**Draw** an entity-relationship diagram to show the relationships between the three tables

Entities and relationships drawn using standard notation **[1]**

Cartridge linked to PrinterModel, PrinterModel linked to PrinterInstance with no other links **[1]**

1:M relationship from Cartridge to Printer Model **[1]**

1:M relationship from PrinterModel to PrinterInstance **[1]**

### Resolving Many to Many Relationships

- **Many to many** relationships cannot be implemented into an actual database and need to be ‘**resolved**’
    
- This involves creating a new table known as a ‘**link**’ table that goes between the entities
    
- This new table **links** the entities that have the **many to many** relationships together
