## Transaction Processing

### What is a Transaction?

- A **transaction** is a sequence of database operations treated as a single unit of work
    
- Ensures data **consistency** and **integrity** during simultaneous access
    
- Example: money transfer between bank accounts. The transaction here would be a withdrawal from one account and a deposit into another. Both operations must happen together or neither should happen
    
- Problems that arise from transaction processing
    
    - **Concurrency**: When multiple transactions are executed simultaneously, they might try to access or modify the same data, leading to inconsistencies
        
    - **Deadlock**: This occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, causing them to wait indefinitely
        
    - **Data Integrity**: Transactions might leave the database in an inconsistent state if they fail in the middle of execution
        
    - **Isolation**: In a multi-user environment, one user's transaction might affect another user's transaction, leading to unpredictable outcomes
        
    - **Durability**: If a system fails after a transaction has been confirmed, it may result in loss of data
        
- Solutions to overcome problems that arise in transaction processing
    
    - **Locking**: Implementing a locking mechanism ensures that no two transactions can access the same data simultaneously. There are two types of locks: shared locks and exclusive locks
        
    - **Deadlock Prevention or Deadlock Detection**: Deadlocks can be prevented by ordering the way in which resources are requested or by having a timeout mechanism
        
    - **Logging and Recovery**: By keeping a log of all changes, the system can recover to a consistent state after a crash
        
    - **Commit and Rollback**: The commit operation saves all changes made in the transaction as permanent. The rollback operation reverts the changes made in the transaction
        
    - **Two-Phase Commit Protocol**: In **distributed systems**, this protocol ensures that a transaction is committed in all participating nodes, or none at all, to maintain consistency
        
    - **Concurrency control**
        
        - Manages simultaneous access to data in a multi-user environment
            
        - Techniques:
            
            - **Locking**: prevents multiple transactions from accessing the same data simultaneously
                
            - **Timestamping**: assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction
                
    - **Transaction management**
        
        - Use database management systems (DBMS) with built-in transaction support
            
        - Implement custom transaction logic using SQL or other query languages
            
        - Test and monitor transactions to ensure ACID compliance and performance
            

## ACID

### ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

- A set of rules that all Database Management Systems (**DBMS**) must use to ensure **data integrity**
    
- Guarantee **reliable processing** of transactions
    
- **Atomicity**
    
    - All operations in a transaction succeed or fail as a whole
        
    - If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back
        
    - Ensures partial transactions do not occur
        
- **Consistency**
    
    - Ensures data remains in a consistent state after transactions
        
    - Transactions must follow database rules and constraints
        
    - Starts with a consistent state and ends with a consistent state
        
- **Isolation**
    
    - Transactions are isolated from each other
        
    - Intermediate states are not visible to other transactions
        
    - Prevents conflicts and data inconsistencies
        
- **Durability**
    
    - Committed transactions persist even in case of system failures
        
    - Ensures data is not lost once a transaction is complete
        

#### Worked Example

**RestaurantReview is a website that allows users to leave reviews and ratings for different restaurants**

**The website uses a database with the following structure**

![erd-worked-example](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/01/erd-worked-example.png)

**The database management system ensures referential integrity is maintained**

**Whenever a review is added to the system, the restaurant’s average rating is updated** 

**Describe what is meant by the term ‘Atomic’ in the context of ACID transactions. You should refer to the example of a review being added**

**[2]**

**Answer:**

 A transaction / review can only fully complete or not complete / cannot partially complete **[1]**

In this case, it should not be possible for the review to be added without the (average) rating being updated  **[1]**

## Record Locking

- **Record locking** is a technique used in database management systems (**DBMS**) to **prevent conflicting access** to data by multiple transactions or processes
    
- It **ensures data consistency** and **integrity** when multiple users or processes try to read, modify, or delete records simultaneously
    
- **Key Concepts**
    
    - Lock: A mechanism that prevents access to a database record by other transactions while a specific transaction is using the record
        
    - Lock granularity: Refers to the size of the locked data, ranging from a single row to an entire table
        
- **Types of Locks**
    
    - Shared lock (Read lock): Allows multiple transactions to read a record simultaneously, but prevents modifications or deletions until the lock is released
        
    - Exclusive lock (Write lock): Allows only one transaction to access and modify a record, blocking other transactions from reading or writing to the locked record until the lock is released
        

- **Benefits of Record Locking**
    
    - Maintains data consistency and integrity by preventing conflicting modifications
        
    - Allows concurrent read access to records without compromising data consistency
        
    - Improves database performance by enabling multiple users to access data simultaneously, while managing access to prevent conflicts
        

## Redundancy

- **Redundancy** can occur when the same piece of data is stored in more than one table in a database. This can either be by accident or by design
    
- It can lead to **inconsistencies** in the data and/or **wasted storage space**
