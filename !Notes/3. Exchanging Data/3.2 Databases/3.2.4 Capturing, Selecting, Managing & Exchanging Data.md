_**Different Types of Sensor**_

#### Barcodes

- Machine-readable representation of data using parallel lines of varying widths and spacings
    
- Commonly used for tracking items, inventory management, and point-of-sale systems
    
- Two main types:
    
    - 1D (One-dimensional) barcodes: represent data using parallel lines (e.g. on products in shops)
        
    - 2D (Two-dimensional) barcodes: use geometric patterns like squares, dots, or hexagons to store data (e.g. QR code)
        
- Advantages of Barcodes
    
    - Fast and accurate data entry
        
    - Reduces human error

#### Data Mining

- Process of discovering hidden patterns, correlations, and insights from large datasets
    
- Involves techniques and algorithms from fields like machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence
    
- Supports decision-making by transforming raw data into valuable information
    
- Applications of data mining
    
    - **Marketing**: Customer segmentation, market basket analysis, and targeted advertising
        
    - **Finance**: Fraud detection, credit scoring, and portfolio management
        
    - **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, patient clustering, and drug discovery
        
    - **Manufacturing**: Quality control, predictive maintenance, and supply chain optimisation
        
    - **Telecommunications**: Network monitoring, customer analysis, and service improvement
        

## Selecting Data

#### Query By Example (QBE)

- User-friendly method for constructing database **queries** using a visual interface
    
- Allows users to search for data by providing an example of the desired output
    

- **Key Features**
    
    - Visual representation: QBE uses a grid or form-based interface, where users can enter criteria in columns representing database fields
        
    - Intuitive: Users don't need to learn complex query syntax, making it accessible for non-technical users
        
    - Flexible: Allows for simple to complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and joining multiple tables
        

- **How QBE Works**
    

- Users enter criteria in the appropriate columns or fields in the QBE grid or form
    
- The QBE system translates the user's input into an equivalent SQL query or other query language
    
- The query is executed against the database, and the results are displayed to the user
    

- **Common Query Operations**
    

- **Filtering**: Users can specify conditions or criteria in the QBE grid to retrieve specific records (e.g., all customers from a particular city)
    
- **Sorting**: Users can indicate the desired sorting order for the results (e.g., ascending or descending by last name)
    
- **Joining**: Users can combine data from multiple related tables by specifying relationships between the tables in the QBE grid
    
- **Aggregation**: Users can perform calculations or summaries on the data (e.g., counting the number of records, calculating averages, or summing values)
    

**Benefits and Drawbacks of Query By Example (QBE)**

|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|
|Easy to learn and use, even for non-technical users|Less powerful and flexible than SQL for complex queries and data manipulation|
|Visual interface makes it simple to understand and modify queries|May not support advanced database features, such as stored procedures or **triggers**|
|Provides a more accessible way to perform database searches compared to writing SQL queries|Can be slower than SQL queries for large datasets or complex operations|

## Managing & Exchanging Data

### Managing Data

- After a database has been created, there must be easy ways of being able to **manage the data**, this includes:
    
    - **Add new data**
        
    - **Edit/modify existing data**
        
    - **Delete data**
        
- This can be achieved by:
    
    - A **database manipulation language** (DML) such as **SQL**
        
    - Built in **facilities of a Database Management System** (DBMS)
