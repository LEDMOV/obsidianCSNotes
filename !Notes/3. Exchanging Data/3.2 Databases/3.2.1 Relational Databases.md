## Relational Databases

### What is a Database?

- A **Database** is an organised collection of data
    
- It allows **easy storage, retrieval, and management** of information
    
- **Electronic databases** offer a number of key benefits:
    
    - Easier to add, delete, modify and update data
        
    - Data can be backed up and copied easier
        
    - Multiple users, from multiple locations, can access the same database at the same time
        

### Database Terminology

|**Term**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|**Field**|A single piece of data in a record|
|**Record**|A group of related fields, representing one data entry|
|**Table**|A collection of records with a similar structure|
|**Primary key**|A unique identifier for each record in a table. Usually an ID number|
|**Compound primary key**  <br>(sometimes called composite)|A combination of (2 or more) fields that is unique for all records|
|**Foreign key**|A field in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. Used to link tables and create relationships|
|**Secondary key**|A field or fields that are indexed for faster searching|
|**Database Management System**  <br>(DBMS)|Software used to manage databases. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL|

## Primary, Foreign & Secondary Keys

### Visualising a database

![visualising-a-database](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/08/visualising-a-database.png)

- This database has 2 **tables** : orders and customers
    
- **Fields**:
    
    -  In the orders table are _order_id, product, total and customer_id_
        
    - In the customers table are _customer_id, first_name, last_name, phone and country_
        
- A **record** would be 1 complete row in either table
    
- order_id is the **primary key** for the orders **table**  
    customer_id is the **primary key** for the customers **table**
    
- In the orders **table** customer_id is a **foreign key** - it links an order back to the customer that made the order in the customer **table**
    

### Indexing (Secondary Keys)

- **Indexing** is a technique used to speed up data retrieval in a **database**
    
- It works in a similar way to the index in a book 
    
- If a student had a maths book and wanted to find the section on factorising, they could start at the first page and look at each page in turn until they found the section they wanted 
    
- But this would be slow, so it is better to look in the **index**  to find where the factorising section is and just go directly to it 
    
- Likewise in a database, certain columns can be **indexed** so that the DBMS does not have to look at every single **record** during a search and can just go to the relevant **records** directly 
    
- This can greatly **speed up searches** 
    
- Fields that are indexed are known as **secondary keys**
    

## Flat File vs Relational Database

- A **flat file database** is one that stores all data in a single table
    
- It is simple and easy to understand but causes data redundancy, inefficient storage and is harder to maintain
    
- A **relational database** is one that organises data into multiple tables 
    
- It uses keys to connect related data which reduces data **redundancy**, makes efficient use of storage and is easier to maintain
    

Consider this example **flat file** table of students 

![flat-file-table](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/08/flat-file-table.png)

- This table has redundant data - the tutor and form room information repeats 
    
- This is inefficient
    
- If a tutor changed their name we would need to find all instances of that name and change them all
    
- Missing any would mean the **table** had inconsistent data
    

A **relational** database would solve this issue:

- A new **table** could be created to store the tutor information and the tutor information in the student table could be moved to the new **table**.  Then a **foreign key** in the student **table** (TutorID) could link a student to their tutor
    

![relational-database](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/08/relational-database.png)

- Now the name of each tutor and their form room is stored only once
    
- This means if they change only one piece of data, the data is updated in the entire **database** and **Inconsistency** is avoided
    

#### Worked Example

**Customers’ details are stored in the flat file database table Customer. An extract of the table is shown below**

![worked-example](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/08/worked-example.png)

**Describe one problem that would arise with the flat file database structure if a customer wanted to insure more than one car at the same time**

**[2]**

**Answer:**

 **One mark per pair**:

Only one customer entry allowed (because of key field)... 

  so would not be able to add second entry **[1]**

Customer data already present/would be repeated...

   resulting in redundant data/wasted space/inconsistencies should changes be made **[1]**
