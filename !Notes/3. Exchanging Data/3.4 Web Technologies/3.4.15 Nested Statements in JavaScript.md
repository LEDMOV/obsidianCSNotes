## Nested Statements in JavaScript

Nesting is **putting one block of code within another.** This is commonly done with `if` statements and loops.

- Nested `if` statements refer to the practice of including one or more conditional statements inside the block of another conditional statement. These nested structures allow you to **create more complex decision-making logic by evaluating multiple conditions** and handling various scenarios within your code
    
- Nested loops refer to the practice of including one or more loops inside the block of another loop. These nested structures allow you to **iterate over multiple sets of data** and create more complex patterns of repetition within your code
    

### Nested If Statements in JavaScript

`If` statements can be nested within each other to handle more intricate conditions and decision-making:

### Nested Loops in JavaScript

The syntax of nested loops involves placing one loop (`for` loop, `while` loop, etc.) inside the block of another loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < outerArray.length; i++) {  
  // Code block for outer loop`

  for (let j = 0; j < innerArray.length; j++) {  
    // Code block for inner loop

    // More nested loops if needed  
  }

  // More code after inner loop
  }
```
#### Example: Nested for loops

_**Nested for loop in JavaScript showing a 2D array with each item in the array being added together to find the sum of the whole array**_

- After the first iteration `sum=1` as it's only added the 1st element which is 1
    
- After the 2nd iteration `sum=3` as it's added the 2nd element (2) to 1
    
- After the 3rd iteration `sum=6` as it's added the 3rd element (3) to the 1 and 2
    
- After the 4th iteration `sum=10` as it's added the 4th element (4) to the 1, 2 and 3
    
- The algorithm continues working its way through the rest of the 2nd row and then moves on to the 3rd
    

#### Example: Nested while loops

This code below does the same as the code above but utilises `while` loops rather than `for` loops:

`const matrix = [`  
  `[1, 2, 3],`  
  `[4, 5, 6],`  
  `[7, 8, 9]`  
`];`

`let i = 0;`  
`while (i < matrix.length) {`  
  `let j = 0;`  
  `while (j < matrix[i].length) {`  
    `console.log(matrix[i][j]);`  
    `j++;`  
  `}`  
  `i++;`  
`}`

#### Examiner Tip

- If you need to check or work out how many times an inner loop is run, multiply the number of outer loop iterations by the number of inner loop iterations. E.g.
    

`for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {`  
  `for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {`  
    `console.log(i * j);`  
  `}`  
`}`

- The outer loop runs 3 times and the inner loop will run 5 times. To find out the total number of times the inner loop will run, multiply 3 by 5 = 15
