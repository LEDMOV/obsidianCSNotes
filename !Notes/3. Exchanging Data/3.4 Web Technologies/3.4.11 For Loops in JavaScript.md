## For Loops in JavaScript

A `for` loop is a control flow statement that **allows a block of code to repeatedly execute for a specified number of iterations**. It provides a concise and structured way to perform repetitive tasks.

### Syntax of a for loop

The syntax of a `for` loop consists of three main parts:

```javascript
for (initialisation; condition; increment/decrement) {  
  // Code to be executed in each iteration`  
}
```

1. **Initialisation**: The initialisation is executed only once at the beginning of the loop. It is used to initialise a counter variable that controls the loop's execution
    
2. **Condition**: The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop continues executing the code block. If the condition evaluates to false, the loop terminates
    
3. **Increment/Decrement**: The increment or decrement statement is executed at the end of each iteration, updating the counter variable to control the loop's progress
    

#### Example 1: Counting from 1 to 5

#### Example 2: Iterating over an array

#### Examiner Tip

- You might have seen `i=i+1` or `i+=1` for incrementing by 1. This is the same as `i++` in JavaScript
    

### For In Loops in JavaScript

- The `for in` the loop **iterates through the items in a data structure like a list or** **array**
    
```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape'];

for (let index in fruits) {
  console.log('Index: ' + index + ', Value: ' + fruits[index]);  
}
```
- The list `fruits` contains four items: `'apple'`, `'banana'`, `'orange'`, and `'grape'`
    
- The `for...in` the loop **iterates over each index of the** `fruits` list
    
- In each iteration, the `index` the variable is assigned the current index value
    
- Inside the loop, we use `fruits[index]` to **access the value associated with the current index**
    
- The loop executes the code block, which outputs the index and value of each item in the list to the browser
