[[!3.4 Web Technologies]]

Fundamental Theories

- **Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking**: The three main stages of how search engines work, where crawling discovers web pages, indexing organizes the data, and ranking determines the order of results based on relevance.
- **Link Analysis in PageRank**: The method of evaluating the importance of web pages based on the quantity and quality of links pointing to them.

Key People

- **Larry Page & Sergey Brin**: Co-founders of Google and developers of the PageRank algorithm, which revolutionized search engine technology.

Seminal Studies

- **PageRank Algorithm Study**: Research conducted by Page and Brin that demonstrated how link analysis could improve search engine results by evaluating the importance of web pages.

Key Procedures/Protocols

|Procedure/Protocol|Description|
|---|---|
|**HTML Structure**|The foundational markup language used to create web pages, consisting of elements like headings, paragraphs, and links.|
|**CSS Styling**|Cascading Style Sheets used to define the visual appearance of web pages, allowing for layout and design customization.|
|**JavaScript Functions**|Blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks, enhancing interactivity and dynamic content on web pages.|

Facts to Memorize

- PageRank algorithm was developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
- The damping factor in PageRank is usually set at 0.85.
- Common server-side programming languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java.
- JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting.
- HTML tags are case-insensitive, but it is a good practice to use lowercase.
- CSS properties must be spelled in American English (e.g., 'color' not 'colour').

Reference Information
- Common CSS properties: background-color, border-color, color, font-family, font-size.
- JavaScript data types: Integer, Real, Char, String, Boolean.

Problem-Solving Steps

To solve a JavaScript problem involving loops:

1. Identify the task to be repeated (e.g., iterating over an array).
2. Choose the appropriate loop (for, while, or do while).
3. Initialize the loop counter (if applicable).
4. Set the loop condition (when to stop).
5. Increment or decrement the counter (if applicable).
6. Write the code block to execute in each iteration.
7. Test the loop with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.

Key Terms/Concepts

- **Search Engine Indexing**: The process of collecting, parsing, and storing data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval.
- **PageRank Algorithm**: A system used by Google to rank web pages in its search engine results, based on the number and quality of links to a page.
- **Server Side Processing**: Operations that are performed on the server, often involving database interactions and dynamic content generation.
- **Client Side Processing**: Operations that are performed on the user's device, typically using JavaScript to enhance user interaction without server requests.
