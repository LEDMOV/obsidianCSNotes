## JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a programming language that **adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to webpages**. It allows a webpage to manipulate HTML elements, perform calculations, handle user input, and more. 

#### Purpose of JavaScript

- JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning **it runs directly in the web browser of the user**
    
- Its purpose is to enhance webpages by enabling interactive features, dynamic content, form validation, and data manipulation
    
    - Interactive features include features like **image sliders, drop-down menus, or interactive maps**, like allowing users to zoom in and out on a Google Maps element embedded in the website
        
    - Dynamic content could be loading more articles or posts when a user reaches the end of a page (**infinite scrolling**), or changing the content based on the user's actions, such as s**howing different product descriptions when a user hovers over product images**
        
    - Form validation could be **checking that all required fields have been filled in**, that an email address has the correct format, or that p**asswords meet certain strength requirements**
        
    - Data manipulation could involve **filtering a list of products based on user-selected criteria**, sorting a table of data, or **creating a dynamic chart that updates in real-time as new data comes in**
        
- JavaScript can respond to user actions, update the content of HTML elements, and communicate with servers to retrieve or send data
    

## Data Types in JavaScript

### Data Types in JavaScript

- A data type is a classification of data into groups according to the **kind of data they represent**
    
- Computers use different data types to represent different types of data in a program
    
- The basic data types include:
    
    - **Integer**: used to represent **whole numbers**, either positive or negative
        
        - Examples: 10, -5, 0
            
    - **Real**: used to represent **numbers with a fractional part**, either positive or negative
        
        - Examples: 3.14, -2.5, 0.0
            
    - **Char**: used to represent a **single character** such as a letter, digit or symbol
        
        - Examples: 'a', 'B', '5', '$'
            
    - **String**: used to represent a **sequence of characters**
        
        - Examples: "Hello World", "1234", "@#$%
            
    - **Boolean**: used to represent **true or false** values
        
        - Examples: True, False
            

We can declare variables as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Syntax**|`let variable_name = value;`|
|**Example**|`let x = 5;`|

It is important to choose the correct data type for a given situation to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the program.
