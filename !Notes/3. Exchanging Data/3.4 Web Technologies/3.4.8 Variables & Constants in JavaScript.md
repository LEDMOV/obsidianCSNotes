## Variables & Constants in JavaScript

**Variables** and **constants** are used to **store a single item of data** in a program. This can be accessed through the identifier. **Variables can be changed during program execution** while **constants remain the same**.

### Declaring variables & constants

- Variables are declared using a [data type](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/3-exchanging-data/3-4-web-technologies/data-types-javascript/#:~:text=A%20data%20type%20is%20a%20classification%20of%20data%20into%20groups%20according%20to%20the%20kind%20of%20data%20they%20represent), a name and a value (optional)
    
- Constants are declared using the 'const' keyword, a name and a value
    
- In all programming languages, **variable names should follow certain rules**, such as:
    
    - Starting with a letter
        
    - Not containing spaces
        
    - Can contain letters, numbers, _ or $
        
    - Not using reserved words (like if, while, for etc.)
        
- Examples of data types include **integer, float, boolean, and string**
    

**Examples in** **pseudocode****:**

Declare a variable called 'score' with a value of 10

`score = 10`

Declare a constant called 'PI' with a value of 3.14

`const PI = 3.14`

**Examples in** **JavaScript****:**

`let score = 10;`

`const PI = 3.14;`  

#### Examiner Tip

- You might see code that declares variables like this
    

`var variableName = value;`

- This is bad practice as it utilises [global variables](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/7-problem-solving-and-programming/7-1-programming-techniques/glocal-and-local-variables/) but was used until 2015 when let was added to JavaScript
