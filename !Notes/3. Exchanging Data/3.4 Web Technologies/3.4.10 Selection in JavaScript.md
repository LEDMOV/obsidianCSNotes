## Selection in JavaScript

- Programming code is made up of constructs which control the flow of a program
    
- Constructs tell the computer the order in which to carry out the statements/lines of code
    
- There are 3 programming constructs:
    
    - **Sequence**
        
    - Selection
        
    - **Iteration**
        
- **Selection is selecting a line/lines of code to run depending on whether a condition is true or false**
    
- There are two ways to write selection statements:
    
    - `If` statements
        
    - `Switch case` statements
        
- When writing a condition there will need to be a [comparison](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/3-exchanging-data/3-4-web-technologies/arithmetic-logical-and-boolean-operators-javascript/) operator. They are listed below: 
    

|**Operator**|**Description**|**Example (where x=5)**|**Returns**|
|---|---|---|---|
|==|equal to|x == 8|false|
|x == 5|true|
|x == "5"|true|
|===|equal value and equal type|x === 5|true|
|x === "5"|false|
|!=|not equal|x != 8|true|
|!==|not equal value or not equal type|x !== 5|false|
|x !== "5"|true|
|x !== 8|true|
|>|greater than|x > 8|false|
|<|less than|x < 8|true|
|>=|greater than or equal to|x >= 8|false|
|<=|less than or equal to|x <= 8|true|

## IF Statements in JavaScript

- An `if the` statement will let you **choose a line/lines of code to run if a condition is true or false** 
    
- Below are three examples of `if` statements:
    

1. `if`
    
2. `if else`
    
3. `if else if else`
    

### Syntax of an if statement

The syntax of an `if` the statement consists of the `if` keyword, followed by **a condition enclosed in brackets**, and **a code block that is executed** if the condition evaluates to `true`:

`if (condition) {`  
  `// Code to be executed if the condition is true`  
`}`

#### Pseudocode example of an if statement

![pseudocode example of an if statement](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/09/if-statement-pseudocode-computer-science-revision-note.png)

#### Example in JavaScript: checking if a number is positive

`const number = 5;`

`if (number > 0) {`  
  `console.log('The number is positive.');`  
`}`

- In this example, the `if` statement **checks if the value of the variable** `number` is greater than `0`. If the condition is true, the message `'The number is positive.'` is output to the browser
    

### Syntax of an if-else statement

The `if the` statement can be extended with an `else` clause to specify an **alternative block of code that is executed when the condition evaluates to** `false`:

`if (condition) {`  
  `// Code to be executed if the condition is true`  
`} else {`

`// Code to be executed if the condition is false`

`}`

**Pseudocode** **example of an if-else statement**

![Pseudocode example of an if-else statement](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/09/if-else-statement-pseudocode-computer-science-revision-notes.png)

**Example in** **JavaScript****: Checking if a number is positive or negative**

`const number = -3;`

`if (number > 0) {`  
  `console.log('The number is positive.');`  
`} else {`  
  `console.log('The number is not positive.');`  
`}`

- In this example, **if the value of** `number` is greater than `0`, the message `'The number is positive.'` is output. Otherwise, the message `'The number is not positive.'` is output
    

### Syntax of an If Else-If Else statement

The `else if` the clause **specifies additional conditions to check if the initial** `if` **condition is false**. This allows the handling of multiple scenarios in a more complex decision-making process:

`if (condition) {`  
  `// Code to be executed if the condition is true`  
`} else if (condition) {`

  `// Code to be executed if the condition is true`  
`} else {`

`// Code to be executed if the condition is false`

`}`

**Pseudocode example of an If Else-If Else statement**

![Pseudocode example of an If Else-If Else statement](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/09/if-else-if-else-statement-pseudocode-computer-science-revision-notes.png)

**Example in JavaScript: Grading a score**

`const score = 85;`

`if (score >= 90) {`  
  `console.log('Excellent!');`  
`} else if (score >= 80) {`  
  `console.log('Good.');`  
`} else if (score >= 70) {`  
  `console.log('Fair.');`  
`} else {`  
  `console.log('Needs improvement.');`  
`}`

- In this example, the `if-else if-else` statement **evaluates the value of** `score` to determine the corresponding message based on the score range
    

#### Examiner Tip

- You can use as many `else if`s as you want to within your `if` statement but it might be clearer to use a `switch case` statement
    
- You can have an `if else-if` statement without an end as the catch-all condition at the end
    

### How do I write my condition?

- Think of it like **writing a yes/no question**
    
- E.g.
    
    - Is the number bigger than 10?
        
    - Is the number between 50 and 100?
        
    - Is the answer Paris?
        
- If the question can’t be answered with yes/no then it needs to be rewritten in this way
    

### Is it possible to use more than one operator?

- Yes! **Using one operator is most common but sometimes 2 are needed**. More than 2 could be used but it gets more complicated. This involves using [boolean](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/3-exchanging-data/3-4-web-technologies/arithmetic-logical-and-boolean-operators-javascript/#:~:text=status%3A%20draft.-,Boolean%20Operators%20JavaScript,-Boolean%20operators%20are) operators
    
- Imagine a program where the user has to enter a number based on the role of a dice. **The number needs to be between 1 and 6**
    
- The yes/no question could be **is the number between 1 and 6** - but it would be structured slightly differently in the code
    
- `IF number >=1 AND number <=6 then`
    
- The first check is **if the number is greater than or equal to 1**
    
- The second check is **if the number is less than or equal to 6**
    
- The final check is if **both sides are True**
    

#### Examiner Tip

- Check whether to use an `AND` or an `OR` in the condition - it’s easy to get these 2 mixed up. E.g.
    
    - `IF number<0 AND number>100` will check if the number is below 0 and greater than 100 (there are no numbers which fit into this range!)
        
    - `IF number<0 OR number>100` will check if the number is between 1 and 99
        

#### Worked Example

**A website sells tickets for sporting events. The website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website charges a booking fee of £2.99 on each ticket sold. In addition, if the tickets are purchased from outside of the UK, £4.99 is added to the booking fee. The booking fee is calculated using a JavaScript function named** `bookingfee()`**.**

**Complete the definition of the** `bookingfee()` **function below.**  
`function bookingfee(numtickets, country) {`  
   `var nonUKprice = 4.99;`  
   `var perTicketPrice = .............................................;`  
   `var total = 0;`  
   `if (country!="UK") {`  
      `total = total + .............................................;`  
   `}`  
   `total = total + (............................................. * perTicketPrice);`  
   `return total;`  
`}`

3 marks

**How to answer this question:**

- The first blank space is to set the value of the `perTicketPrice`. The question tells us this is £2.99
    
- The 2nd blank space is to add something to `total` if the country is not equal to UK. The question tells us that if the tickets are purchased from outside the UK, £4.99 is added to the booking fee. This is stored in the `nonUKprice` variable
    
- The 3rd blank space is something multiplied by `perTicketPrice`. The question tells us each ticket is £2.99 so we need to multiply the `perTicketPrice` by the number of tickets (called `numtickets`)
    

Answer:

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

`function bookingfee(numtickets, country) {`  
   `var nonUKprice = 4.99;`  
   `var perTicketPrice = 2.99;`  
   `var total = 0;`  
   `if (country!="UK") {`  
      `total = total + nonUKprice;`  
   `}`  
   `total = total + (numtickets * perTicketPrice);`  
   `return total;`  
`}`

#### Examiner Tip

- When you're given code in a question that you need to refer to or complete, you must spell existing identifier names exactly as they have in the question. E.g. if you write `numtikets` instead of `numtickets` you won't get the mark
    
- Also, make sure you don't include £ in the calculation - this will be added as an output and will cause the calculation to not work as it's included a character that's not an integer
    

## Switch Case in JavaScript

- `Switch Case` is a type of conditional statement that **provides an alternative way to perform multiple comparisons** based on the value of an expression
    
- These statements are particularly useful when you have **a single expression that you want to compare against multiple possible values**
    

### Syntax of a Switch Case statement

- The syntax of a `switch case` statement consists of the `switch` keyword followed by an expression enclosed in brackets
    
- This expression is evaluated, and its value is then compared against various `case` labels. **If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed**
    
- The `default` keyword is optional and specifies a **block of code to be executed if none of the case labels match** the expression:
    

`switch (expression) {`  
  `case value1:`  
    `// Code to be executed if the expression matches value1`  
    `break;`  
  `case value2:`  
    `// Code to be executed if the expression matches value2`  
    `break;`  
  `// more case statements`  
  `default:`  
    `// Code to be executed if no case matches the expression`  
`}`

### Switch case example in JavaScript: Grades evaluation

![Switch case example in JavaScript: Grades evaluation](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/09/switch-case-javascript-computer-science-revision-notes.png)

### Fall-Through behaviour

By default, `switch case` has a fall-through behaviour, meaning that if a case label matches, **the code execution continues to the next case until a** `break` statement is encountered. This allows you to group multiple cases with the same code:

`const day = 'Monday';`

`switch (day) {`  
  `case 'Monday':`  
  `case 'Tuesday':`  
  `case 'Wednesday':`  
  `case 'Thursday':`  
  `case 'Friday':`  
    `console.log('Weekday');`  
    `break;`  
  `case 'Saturday':`  
  `case 'Sunday':`  
    `console.log('Weekend');`  
    `break;`  
  `default:`  
    `console.log('Invalid day.');`  
`}`

- In this example, if `day` is 'Tuesday', 'Weekday' is logged to the console because it falls through the cases of 'Monday' to 'Friday' until a `break` statement is encountered
