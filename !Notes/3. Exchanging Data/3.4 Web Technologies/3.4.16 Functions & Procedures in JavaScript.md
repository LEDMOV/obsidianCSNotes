## Functions & Procedures in JavaScript

- Functions and procedures are essential building blocks that allow you to **enclose blocks of code and execute them as needed**
    
- They promote code **reusability, modularity, and organisation**, enabling a programmer to write efficient and maintainable programs
    

### Considerations and Best Practices

- **Naming**: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for your functions and procedures that indicate their purpose
    
- **Parameter** **Names**: Use clear and meaningful parameter names to improve code readability
    
- **Function Length**: Aim for functions and procedures that are short and focused
    
- **Return Values**: Functions should have explicit return statements with meaningful return values, while procedures should not have return statements
    

### Functions in JavaScript

A function is a **reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculation** and can be **called** from anywhere in the code. Functions can take input parameters (arguments) and **return a value**.

The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

`function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {`  
  `// Code block to perform the task`  
  `// Return value;`  
`}`

_**Function in JavaScript**_

#### Worked Example

**A website sells tickets for sporting events. The website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website charges a booking fee of £2.99 on each ticket sold. In addition, if the tickets are purchased from outside of the UK, £4.99 is added to the booking fee. The booking fee is calculated using a JavaScript function named** `bookingfee()`.

**Complete the definition of the** `bookingfee()` **function below.**  
`function bookingfee(numtickets, country) {`  
   `var nonUKprice = 4.99;`  
   `var perTicketPrice = .............................................;`  
   `var total = 0;`  
   `if (country!="UK") {`  
      `total = total + .............................................;`  
   `}`  
   `total = total + (............................................. * perTicketPrice);`  
   `............................................. total;`  
`}`

4 marks

**How to answer this question:**

- The first blank space is to set the value of the `perTicketPrice`. The question tells us this is £2.99
    
- The 2nd blank space is to add something to `total` if the country is not equal to UK. The question tells us that if the tickets are purchased from outside the UK, £4.99 is added to the booking fee. This is stored in the `nonUKprice` variable
    
- The 3rd blank space is something multiplied by `perTicketPrice`. The question tells us each ticket is £2.99 so we need to multiply the `perTicketPrice` by the number of tickets (called `numtickets`)
    
- The 4th blank space is the last line of the function. As it's a function, a value must be returned. A value hasn't yet been returned in this function so `total` must be the value returned
    

Answer:

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

`function bookingfee(numtickets, country) {`  
   `var nonUKprice = 4.99;`  
   `var perTicketPrice = 2.99;`  
   `var total = 0;`  
   `if (country!="UK") {`  
      `total = total + nonUKprice;`  
   `}`  
   `total = total + (numtickets * perTicketPrice);`  
   `return total;`  
`}`

### Procedures in JavaScript

- A procedure is similar to a function but **does not return a value**. Instead, it **performs a series of actions or operations** which could be anything the programmer wants the procedure to execute
    
- **A procedure is essentially a function without a** `return` **statement** or with a `return` statement that has no value to return
    

The syntax is the same as for functions:

`function procedureName(parameter1, parameter2) {`  
  `// Code block to perform actions`  
  `// No return statement or return with no value;`  
`}`
