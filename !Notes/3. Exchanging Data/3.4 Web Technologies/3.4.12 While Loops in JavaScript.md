## While Loops in JavaScript

- A `while` loop is a control flow statement that **allows a block of code to repeatedly execute as long as a specified condition remains true**
    
- `While` loops provide a flexible and powerful way to handle situations **where the number of iterations is unknown in advance**
    

### Syntax of a while loop

The syntax of a `while` the loop consists of a condition and a code block:

```javascript
while (condition) { 
  // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true`  
}
```

- The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code block is executed. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates
    

#### Example 1: Counting from 1 to 5

## Do While Loops in JavaScript

- A `do while` loop is a control flow statement that **allows a block of code to repeatedly execute at least once, and then continue execution as long as a specified condition remains true**
    
- `Do while` loops provide a variation of the while loop with slightly different behaviour
    

### Syntax of a do while loop

The syntax of a `do while` the loop consists of a code block and a condition:
```javascript
do { 
  // Code to be executed at least once 
} while (condition);
```

- **Code Block**: The code block is executed first before evaluating the condition
    
- **Condition**: The condition is evaluated after executing the code block. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop continues executing. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates
    

#### Example: Rolling a die until a desired number is obtained

#### Examiner Tip

- You can use either a `while` loop or a `do while` loop but don't forget that a `do while` loop will always run once before checking if the condition is true
