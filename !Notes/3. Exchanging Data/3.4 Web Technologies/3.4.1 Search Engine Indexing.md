## Search Engine Indexing

### How do search engines work?

Search engines work in several stages:

- Crawling - think of this as gathering all of the books within a library
    
- Indexing - think of this as reading the books and making a structured list of the information within the books
    
- [Ranking](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/3-exchanging-data/3-4-web-technologies/pagerank-algorithm/) - think of this as recommending books to the reader
    

#### Crawling

- Web pages are discovered by search engines through **software programs called crawlers** (or spiders, bots, or robots) 
    
- Crawlers **follow links from one webpage to another**, systematically visiting pages on the web
    
- They start from a set of seed URLs and visit other pages linked from those URLs
    
- Website crawlers **follow rules and guidelines established by website owners**, using mechanisms like the `robots.txt` file. These guidelines **direct crawlers on which areas of a website to explore or avoid**, respecting website preferences and ensuring privacy
    
- Once a crawler reaches a webpage, it **fetches the** **HTML** **content** of that page
    
- The crawler **examines the HTML structure and retrieves information**, such as text content, headings, links, and **metadata**
    
- To understand the structure of the webpage, **the HTML that was retrieved is broken down into individual components**
    
- This process involves **identifying elements, tags, and attributes** that hold valuable information like titles and headings
    

#### Indexing

- The data extracted from the webpage is indexed, which involves storing the collected information in a structured manner within a search engine's database
    
-  Each word in the document is included in the page's index as an entry, along with the word’s position on the page
    
- The **index allows for quick retrieval and ranking of relevant web pages** in response to user queries
    

#### Ranking

- When a user enters a query, the search engine searches the index for matching pages and returns the results they believe are the highest quality and most relevant to the user's query
    

### Benefits of search engine crawling & indexing

- The process of search engine **indexing** is **essential for** **search engines** to collect, examine and arrange online content
    
- It involves **collecting and storing information from web pages** in a searchable index
    

There are many reasons for search engine crawling and indexing to happen:

- Improved search results
    
- Efficient retrieval
    
- Ranking and relevance
    
- Freshness and updates
    

#### Improved search results

- Indexing webpages means search engines can:
    
    - Provide users with **relevant and up-to-date search results**
        
    - Match user searches with content which **increases the chances of accurate and valuable results**
        
- This means the user is **more likely to find what they're looking for quickly**, ideally on the first page of search results, without having to go to additional pages
    

#### Efficient retrieval

- Indexing enables **efficient retrieval of information**
    
- Search engines don't need to scan the entire web for every search query. They can just **search their indexed data to produce search results quickly**
    

#### Ranking & relevance

- Indexing enables search engines to **assess the relevance and quality of web pages**
    
- Search result **rankings are determined by various ranking algorithms** that analyse indexed data. These algorithms consider factors such as **keyword relevance,** **backlinks****, and user engagement** 
    

#### Freshness & updates

- Search engine crawlers **periodically revisit indexed web pages to detect updates and changes**
    
- This process guarantees that the search results **display the latest content** that is currently accessible on the Internet
    
- If a webpage has been updated and not re-crawled, the page may no longer be relevant for the user's search
