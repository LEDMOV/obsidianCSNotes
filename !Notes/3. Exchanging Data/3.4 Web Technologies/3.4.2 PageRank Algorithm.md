## PageRank Algorithm

- A crucial element of search ranking algorithms is the Page Rank algorithm
    
    - The algorithm was developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin
        
    - Many search engines rely on it, particularly Google
        
- **Web pages are evaluated and ranked by the algorithm** based on their perceived relevance and importance
    

### Why is the PageRank algorithm important?

- The PageRank algorithm was created to **tackle the difficulty of determining the importance of web pages** with the **immense amount of information available**
    
- The purpose of the algorithm is to **provide better search results that are more precise and related** by taking into account various factors beyond just matching keywords
    

### Key elements of the PageRank algorithm

There are 4 key elements to the PageRank algorithm:

- Link analysis
    
- Link weight distribution
    
- Iterative calculation
    
- Damping factor
    

#### Link analysis

- The PageRank algorithm **analyses the structure of links between pages** on the web
    
- **Web pages are given importance** by the algorithm, which considers the **quantity and quality of inbound links from other pages**
    
- Each **link acts as a "vote" for the target page**, with the voting weight determined by the importance of the linking page
    
- Websites that have **more high-quality links pointing towards them** are deemed to be more valuable and pertinent and have a higher weight
    
- Webpages with a **higher weight will score more highly** and have a higher ranking
    

#### Link weight distribution

- **The importance of a webpage is calculated by PageRank**, which takes into account the total number of "votes" it has received
    
- The algorithm distributes the importance of a page to the pages it links to by s**haring a portion of its importance with each outgoing link**
    
- By following this process, **pages of superior quality are given greater importance** and make a larger impact in determining the ranking of other pages
    

#### Iterative calculation

- The PageRank algorithm uses a **repetitive calculation** process. At the beginning, every webpage is given the same value to start with
    
- In subsequent iterations, **the significance of each page is re-evaluated** by considering the weighted impact of inbound links
    
- The process continues until the rankings become stable
    

#### Damping factor

- In order to avoid infinite loops, an algorithm introduces a **damping factor that ranges between 0 and 1 (usually set at 0.85)**
    
- The damping factor is the **likelihood of a user clicking on a link at random** rather than following the links on the current page
    
- The damping factor ensures that the **ranking calculation includes user behaviour** and maintains harmony between discovering new links and staying on the current page
    

### Factors influencing PageRank

Although the initial PageRank algorithm mainly concentrated on link analysis, present-day search engines consider many factors to improve search results rankings. These factors may include:

- Relevance
    
- User engagement
    
- Authority and trust
    
- Content freshness
    
- Mobile-friendliness
    

#### Relevance

- The **content of a web page is a crucial factor** in determining its ranking in search results. This is influenced by the **keywords** used, the **quality** of the content, and **how relevant it is** to the search query
    

#### User engagement

- **The way users interact with a website can be measured through metrics** like click-through rates, time spent on a page (dwell time), and bounce rates. These metrics can reveal the level of user engagement
    
- Pages that receive **greater engagement from users may be deemed more valuable**
    

#### Authority & trust

- The **reputation** and authority of a webpage or website **play a crucial role**
    
- **Several factors can enhance a website's ranking**, including the **age** of the domain, **quality** **backlinks** from reputable sources e.g. government website or the BBC, and **trustworthy content** 
    

#### Content freshness

- Search engines value **fresh and up-to-date content**
    
- Search queries may give **priority to web pages that are frequently updated** or have up-to-date information
    

#### Mobile-friendliness

- As mobile devices became more prominent, **search engines started to factor in the mobile compatibility of web pages** when determining their ranking
    
- Google primarily **uses the mobile version of a site's content to rank pages** from that site
    
- Having a responsive design and **optimising the user experience on mobile devices can have a positive impact** on a website's rankings
    

### Limitations & evolving nature

- Although the **PageRank algorithm** is important in search engine rankings, it **is not the only factor** that determines them
    
- **Search engines use different algorithms** and factors to guarantee that they provide varied, relevant, and top-quality search outcomes
    
- Over time, the **details of the PageRank algorithm have undergone changes**. Search engines regularly enhance their ranking methods to cater to new challenges and meet user expectations
    

### How does PageRank work?

- To illustrate how PageRank works, let's use **players in a football match** where:
    
    - Each **player represents a page**
        
    - Each **pass between 2 players represents a link** between 2 pages

_**PageRank Analogy - a team of football players**_

- The main things PageRank uses are:
    
    - The number of links the page gets (or the **number of passes a player receives**)
        
    - The importance of a page is determined by the number of links pointing towards it or by **how frequently the player who passed the ball is passed to**
        
- The PageRank of each player gets **updated every time they receive the ball**
    
- This continues throughout the game

_**PageRank Analogy - the players receive a numerical rating based on number and frequency of passes**_

- As **more passes are made, the PageRank of each player undergoes changes**
    
- As a result, the PageRank of every player they pass to will be altered
    
- The **number represents each player's PageRank - the higher the number, the better**
    
- Once the game concludes, players can be ranked to determine the best performer
