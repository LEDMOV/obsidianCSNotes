## Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption

### What is Encryption?

- Encryption is crucial for converting **readable data** into an **unreadable format**
    
- Its primary aim is to **secure** data from **unauthorised access,** making it a highly important technique for defending against cyber-attacks and data breaches
    
- Encryption methods use **'keys'**, which are specialised programs designed to **scramble** or **unscramble** data
    
- Selecting a type of encryption isn't a daily choice for most people
    
    - Modern devices and technologies, e.g. web browsers (HTTPS protocol), provide a basic level of encryption by default
        
    - Most people transfer sensitive data **without thinking about it** because of developments in technology
        

### How does Symmetric Encryption work?

- The sender uses a key to **encrypt** the data before transmission
    
- The receiver **uses the same key** to **decrypt** the data
    
- It's usually **faster**, making it ideal for encrypting **large amounts of data**
    
- The significant downside is **the challenge of securely sharing this key** between the sender and receiver
    
- If a **bad actor** captures the key, they can **decrypt all messages intercepted** in transmission

### How does Asymmetric Encryption work?

- Asymmetric encryption uses **two keys**:
    
    - a **public key** for encryption
        
    - and a **private key** for decryption
        
- **Receivers** openly share their **public key**
    
- **Senders** use this public key to **encrypt** the data
    
- The **receiver's private key** is the **only key** that can decrypt the data and is kept locally on their side
    
- The public and private keys are created at the same time and are **designed to work together** in this way
    
- It is typically **slower than symmetric encryption**
    
- It is generally used for **more secure and smaller** data transactions, e.g. **passwords**, **bank details**

### Choosing an Encryption type

- **Symmetric encryption is fast** but has key-sharing issues; **asymmetric is slower** but solves these issues.
    
- The choice should be made based on the **situation's needs**: whether **speed** or **security** is more critical.
    

|**Encryption Type**|**Suitable For**|**Reasons to choose**|
|---|---|---|
|**Symmetric**|Large files, databases|- Fast and efficient for bulk data.<br>    <br>- The same person encrypts and decrypts, e.g. when backing up data.|
|**Asymmetric**|Confidential/secret communications|- Sharing highly secure data, e.g. passwords, government communications|

**How to Answer This Question:**

Structuring your answer carefully is the best approach for gaining the most marks for the question. Use the list below as a guide:

1. Start with an introduction outlining the importance of modern encryption in society. Consider some scenarios where private data is being transferred, such as at school or the workplace.
    
2. Discuss the **key features of asymmetric encryption**, emphasising its significance and how it **resolves key distribution issues**.
    
3. **Compare asymmetric** **and** **symmetric encryption**, pointing out the differences and mentioning the single key used in the latter.
    
4. Provide **examples of scenarios** where symmetric and asymmetric encryption are most suitable, discussing the pros and cons of each. 
    
5. Conclude by **summarising the overall impact of both types** of encryption on society, including data security, online transactions, and individual privacy. 
    

**Answer:**

 **Example Answer That Gets Full Marks:**

Encryption is critical to protect people from data misuse in today's digital society. It's a fundamental aspect of secret communications, e-commerce, and the protection of personal information.

Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This solves a crucial issue in key distribution, as the public key can be openly shared without compromising the secure private key. Asymmetric encryption forms the backbone of secure online transactions and communications, enabling features like digital signatures and secure key exchange.

Unlike asymmetric encryption, symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. While it's usually faster and more efficient for handling large data, it poses a challenge in securely sharing the key between parties. Asymmetric encryption, though generally slower, alleviates this issue by using a public-private key pair, adding an extra layer of security.

Symmetric encryption is ideal for quick scenarios, such as encrypting large files or databases within a secure network where key distribution is not an issue. Asymmetric encryption is preferred in situations demanding high security, like secure email communications or online banking, where a compromise in key distribution can lead to significant risks.

Using symmetric and asymmetric encryption profoundly impacts society, enabling secure data transmission, enhancing online commerce, and protecting individual privacy. However, the consequences of providing individuals with highly secure methods of communication mean that regular users can communicate for nefarious reasons, such as organised crime. For situations where an individual must choose between the two methods, they should consider if the data transfer needs to happen quickly or securely.
