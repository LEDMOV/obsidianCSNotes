[[!3.1 Compression, Encryption & Hashing]]

## Run Length Encoding & Dictionary Coding

### What is Run-Length Encoding?

- **Run-Length Encoding** (RLE) is a form of data compression that condenses identical elements into a single value with a count.
    
- For a text file, "AAAABBBCCDAA" is compressed to "4A3B2C1D2A"
    
- The string has four 'A's, followed by three 'B's, two 'C's, one 'D', and two 'A's. RLE shows this as "4A3B2C1D2A"
    
- It is used in bitmap images to compress sequences of the same colour
    
- For example, a line in an image with 5 red pixels followed by 3 blue pixels could be represented as "5R3B"
    

### What is Dictionary Coding?

- Dictionary coding replaces recurring sequences with shorter, unique codes
    
- A 'dictionary' is compiled to map original sequences to special codes
    
- This method is effective for both **text** and **binary data**
    
- The phrase "for example" could be coded as 'FE' if 'FE' doesn't appear in the original text
    
- A sequence of binary numbers '1010' could be replaced by a shorter unique code
    

#### Example of Dictionary Coding

- Consider this sentence where some algorithm names are **repeatedly** mentioned:
    
    - `QuickSort is faster than BubbleSort but MergeSort is more stable than QuickSort and BubbleSort.`
        

- Here, the names `QuickSort`, `BubbleSort`, and `MergeSort` are repeated.
    
- Create a dictionary:
    
    - Start with an empty dictionary.
        
    - Scan the sentence for recurring sequences.
        
    - The dictionary might look like this:

```java
`{`  
   `QuickSort: Q`  
   `BubbleSort: B`  
   `MergeSort: M`  
`}````

- Replace the sequences
    
    - The **repetitive** words in the sentence can be replaced with the dictionary values:
        
        - Original: `QuickSort is faster than BubbleSort but MergeSort is more stable than QuickSort and BubbleSort.`
            
        - Compressed: `Q is faster than B but M is more stable than Q and B.`
            

- The original string was **95 characters long**, and the dictionary-coded example is **53 characters long**
    
    - The shorter string will **require less space** in memory or storage
        

#### Examiner Tip

- RLE and Dictionary Coding serve different needs and have their advantages and disadvantages
    
- **RLE**: More effective when data has lots of repetition
    
- **Dictionary Coding**: More versatile but may require more computational resources
    

#### Worked Example

**A survey focuses on the kinds of vehicles travelling on a motorway. For each vehicle that passes, a letter is noted:**

- **For a car, 'C' is entered.**
    
- **For a motorbike, 'M' is entered.**
    
- **For a lorry, 'L' is entered.**
    
- **For any other vehicle, 'O' is entered.**
    

**It's decided to compress the data generated.**

**Run Length Encoding has compressed the following sequence:**

`3C3M4C`

**Show the result of decompressing the sequence.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**  
Run Length Encoding (RLE) shows the number of consecutive occurrences of a character in a sequence. To decompress, repeat each character the number of times indicated by the preceding number.

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**  
`CCCMMMCCCC`

#### Worked Example

**The following sequence represents the raw data collected during the survey:**  
`CCCCOLLLCCCCCMOCCCCC`

**Show the result of compressing the sequence.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**  
To compress using RLE, count consecutive occurrences of each character and append the count before the character itself.

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**  
`4C1O3L5C1M1O5C`

#### Worked Example

**Write pseudocode for the function "longest", which takes in a string of characters as an argument and returns an integer representing the longest continuous sequence of 'C's.**

[6]

  
**How to answer this question**  
Write pseudocode for a function that iterates through the string, counting continuous sequences of 'C's and keeping track of the longest such sequence.

For example, in `ABCCCBAACC` the longest consecutive string of 'C's is 3.

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks**

**How this answer might look in pseudocode:**

```
Function longest(s: String) -> Integer:    
	max_count = 0
	current_count = 0
	
	For each character in s:
		If char equals 'C':
			Increment current_count by 1
			If current_count > max_count:
				Set max_count to current_count
		Else:
			Set current_count to 0
	Return max_count
```

**How this answer might look in Python:**

```python
def longest(s):
	max_count = 0
	current_count = 0
	
	for char in s:
		if char == 'C':
			current_count += 1
		else:
			current_count = 0
			if current_count > max_count:
				max_count = current_count 
	return max_count`
```
**How this answer might look in Java:**

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(longest("ABCACCCCCABAC"));  // Output should be 5     
	}      
	
	public static int longest(String s) {         
		int maxCount = 0;         
		int currentCount = 0;          
		
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {             
			char currentChar = s.charAt(i); 
			             
			if (currentChar == 'C') {                 
				currentCount++;        
				if (currentCount > maxCount) {                     
					maxCount = currentCount;                 
				}             
			} else {                 
				currentCount = 0;             
			}         
		} 
			         
		return maxCount;     
	} 
}```

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**  

You could use different variable names or loop structures, but the logic should be the same to get full marks.
