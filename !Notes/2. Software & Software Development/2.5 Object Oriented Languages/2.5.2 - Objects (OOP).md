## Objects (OOP)
[[!2.5 Object Oriented Languages]]

### What is an Object?

- An **object** is a representation of a real-world entity eg teacher, aeroplane, mobile phone, cat etc
    
- A **class** is like a blueprint that describes the properties and behaviours of objects, while an **object** is a specific instance created based on that blueprint with its own unique values for the properties
    
- A constructor is a special **method** within a class that is automatically called when an **object** of that class is created  (**instantiated**)
    
- **Constructors** typically define the initial values of **instance variables** and perform any necessary setup to prepare the **object** for use

_**Example of 2 objects belonging to a class**_

#### Worked Example

**A supermarket uses an object-oriented approach to organise items that it offers for sale. Part of the class definition for the ItemForSale class is shown below:**

`class ItemForSale`  
   `public itemName`  
   `public price`  
   `public discount`

**Write a line of code to create an object of type** `ItemForSale` **called** `mushypeas` **that has a name of “mushy peas” and a price of £0.89**   

[3]

**How to answer this question:**

- Creating object with identifier
    
    - mushypeas =
        
- creating object as type
    
    - ItemForSale
        
- mark for parameters passed in as needed ("mushy peas",0.89) [1 mark]
    

**Answer:**

 **Example answer 1 to get full marks:**

`mushypeas=new ItemForSale("mushy peas", 0.89)`

**Example answer 2 to get full marks:**

`ItemForSale mushypeas = ItemForSale(“mushy peas”,0.89);`
