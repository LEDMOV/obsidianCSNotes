## Inheritance (OOP)

### What is Inheritance?

- **Inheritance** is a key concept in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** that allows a **class** to inherit the properties and behaviours (methods and attributes) of another class
    
- **Inheritance** promotes code reuse by allowing **derived classes** to inherit and utilise the existing code from the **base class**. This avoids duplicating code and promotes better organization and maintainability
    
- **Inheritance** establishes an **"IS-A" relationship** between the base class and the derived class
    
- For example, if you have a base class called Vehicle and a derived class called Car, you can say that "a Car is a Vehicle."
    
- The car class **inherits** the properties and behaviours associated with being a vehicle
    
- Inheritance involves two main entities:
    
    - The **base class** (also known as the parent class or superclass) and the derived class (also known as the child class or subclass)
        
    - The **derived class** inherits the characteristics of the base class, meaning it can access and use the methods and attributes defined in the base class

_**Example of a base class and derived classes**_

- **Base Class**: The base class serves as the blueprint or template from which the derived class inherits 
    
    - It defines common properties and behaviours that can be shared among multiple derived classes
        
- **Derived Class**: The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class
    
    - It can add additional attributes and methods
        
- If a car object was to be created, it may have the following attributes:
    
    - Manufacturer - The company that makes the car
        
    - Make -The model of the car
        
    - Cost – The price of the car to purchase
        
    - IsInsured – Whether or not the car is insured
        
    - EngineCapacity – The size of the engine for the car
        

- It may also have access to the following **methods**:
    
    - TurnEngineOn() – To start the car engine
        
    - TurnEngineOff() – To turn off the car engine
        
    - SteerLeft() – To turn the car to the left
        
    - SteerRight() – To steer the car to the left
        
    - GearChange() – To change the gear of the car
        
    - UnlockDoors() – To unlock the doors to the car
        

- The above **methods** are only a select few and there could be many more added for extra functionality
    

- In the following code, the **super keyword** is used in inheritance to refer to the superclass (Base class: Vehicles) and access its members (methods, attributes, or constructors) from within the subclass (Derived Class: Cars)
    

#### Worked Example

**The classes office and house inherit from building.**  
**Describe what is meant by inheritance with reference to these classes.**

 [2]

**How to answer this question**:

- 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 2 marks, e.g:  
    
    - When the child/derived/subclass class office/house takes on attributes/methods…
        
    -  … from building / parent/base/superclass/ class
        

**Answer:**

 **Example answer to get full marks:**

When the derived classes "office" and "house" inherit attributes/methods **[1]** from the "building" base class, they gain access to the properties and behaviours defined in the "building" class. **[1]**
