## Polymorphism (OOP)

### What is Polymorphism?

- **Polymorphism** is a concept in programming that allows **objects** to take on different forms or behaviours.
    
- Different **objects** can share the same name or behaviour but can work in different ways
    
- It helps make code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain
    
- It allows flexibility and reusability in programming, making it easier to write and manage code
    
- **Objects** can be treated as belonging to a common group, even if they belong to different **classes**, making your code more versatile and adaptable to changes
    

### Example 1 – Method Overloading

_**Method Overloading Example 1**_

- In the example above, all three **classes** all have a **method** named `move()`. **Polymorphism** allows methods to be declared with the same name but execute different code (in this case printing different messages)
    
- The **override** keyword Is used to provide a new **implementation** for a method that is already defined in the parent class (**base class**)
    

### Example 2 - Method Overloading

![Method Overloading Example 2](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/10/method-overloading2.png)

_**Method Overloading Example 2**_

- In the above example both the Motorcycle class and the Car class both **inherit** from the base class 'Cars'
    
- **Objects** from the Motorcycle Class and the Car class can call the `startEngines()` **method** which will output `"Engines Started!"`
    
- If either of the object types call the `displayInfo()` method, the program will execute the method from the objects class as it **overrides** the Vehicle class method
    
- For example
    
    - If a motorcycle object calls the `displayInfo()` method, `"I am a Motorcycle!"` will be output
        
    - If a Car object calls the `displayInfo()` method, `"I am a Car!"` will be output
        

### Treating objects as common groups

- **Polymorphism** also allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common **superclass** or **base class**
    
- For example:
    
    - `Vehicle vehicle1 = new Car()`
        
    - `Vehicle vehicle2 = new Motorcycle()`
        
- This allows an array of type Vehicle to store both Motorcycle and Car objects rather than in separate data structures
    
    - If the `vehicle1.displayInfo()` method is called, it will still output "I am a Car!"
        
    - If the `vehicle2.displayInfo()` method is called, it will still output "I am a Motorcycle!"
        
- This flexibility provided by **polymorphism** are essential for creating more maintainable and modular code
