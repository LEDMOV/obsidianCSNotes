[[!2.5 Object Oriented Languages]]

## Classes (OOP)

### What is a Class?

- **Classes** are used as blueprints or templates that can be used to create **objects** within Object Oriented Programming or OOP
    
- An object is created from a specific instance of a class and has its own **state** and **behaviours**
    
- Using this method allows for reusable and organised code in a modular way
    
- Consider a **class** of students
    
    - Each student has a name, a date of birth and gender
        

- Therefore we can create a blueprint or template for all students by making a class which contains these three **attributes**
    
- As each student (or object) is created they will each have their own name, date of birth and gender attributes along with their own state for example
    
    - Name “John”
        
    - Date of birth “06/10/2015”
        
    - Gender “Male”
        

- Some **classes** are already prebuilt into a programming language saving the developer from having to write them from scratch and often provide common functionality
    

- Examples from Java include:
    
    - Date and calendar when working with dates
        
    - String when working with strings of text
        
    - Random when generating random numbers
        
    - Scanner when reading input from a user or file
        

- Custom classes are created by the programmer to define new data types
    

- For example, a class for animals does not exist and so the programmer must define a custom class
    

- **Instantiation** is the term used for creating an **object** from a class
    

- Each class contains **attributes** which are essentially variables within a class and are also known as Class Variables
    

- **Objects** that are created from a **class** contain attributes which are also known as instance variables
    

- Classes can also contain **methods**/functions/procedures
    

- **Methods** are actions or behaviours that can be performed
    
- The name that is used to refer to an **object** is known as the **identifier**
    
- Below is a visual representation of both a **class** and **objects** that have been **instantiated**
    
- In the image below, the identifiers are P1 and P2

#### Examiner Tip

- Although you may see the terms **methods**/functions/ procedures, a method can be either a function or a procedure
    
- A function is a method that must return a value
    
- A procedure is a method that does not need to return a value

**How to answer this question:**

- Classes provide a way to organize code in a modular way [1]
    
- A blueprint or template for creating objects with specific attributes [1]
    

**Answer:**

 **Example answer to get full marks:**

A class is acts as a blueprint or template for creating objects with specific attributes [1 mark], while also providing a way to organize code in a modular fashion. [1 mark]
