# Modes of Addressing in Assembly Language

## Immediate Addressing
- The operand is part of the instruction itself.
- **Example**: `MOV AX, 1234h` Moves the immediate hex value `1234h` to the `AX` register.

## Direct Addressing
- The memory address of the operand is directly specified in the instruction.
- **Example**: `MOV AX, [1234h]` Takes the value stored in memory location `1234h` and moves it to the `AX` register.

## Indirect Addressing
- A register contains the memory address of the operand.
- **Example**: If `BX` contains the value `2000h`: `MOV AX, [BX]` moves the value from memory location `2000h` to the `AX` register. This means "Look in memory address `2000h` (the value currently stored in the `BX` register) and move the data found there into the `AX` register." 
> **Note**: When brackets `[]` surround a register in assembly language (e.g., `[BX]`), it instructs to treat the registerâ€™s value as a memory address and use the data at that address for the operation.

## Indexed Addressing
- Combines a base address with an index to compute the effective address.
- **Example**: If `BX` contains `0050h` and `SI` has a base address `1000h`: `MOV AX, [BX + SI]` moves the value at memory location `1050h` to `AX`. Here, `1000h + 0050h = 1050h`, and the value from `1050h` is moved into `AX`.
