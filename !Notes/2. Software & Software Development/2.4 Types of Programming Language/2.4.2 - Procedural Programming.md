[[!2.4 Types of Programming Language]]

## Procedural Programming

- Procedural programming follows a step-by-step approach to breaking down tasks into routines and subroutines
    
- It emphasises modular design, where code is grouped into functions and procedures for reuse and clarity
    
- Variables hold state and control structures that determine the flow of execution in the program
    

### Variables

- Storing data values that can change
    

`x = 10`  
`print(x) # Output: 10`

### Constants

- Storing values that remain unchanged
    

`PI = 3.1415`  
`print(PI) # Output: 3.1415`

### Selection

- Decision-making constructs
    

`x = 7`  
`if x > 5:`  
`print("Greater") # Output: Greater`  
`else:`  
`print("Smaller")`

### Iteration

- Using loops to repeat actions
    

`for i in range(3):`  
`print(i) # Output: 0, 1, 2`

### Sequence

- Executing statements sequentially
    

`x = 5`  
`y = x + 10`  
`print(y) # Output: 15`

### Subroutines

- Organising code into reusable parts
    

`def greet(name):`  
`return "Hello, " + name`  
  
`greeting = greet("Alice")`  
`print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice`

### String Handling

- Operations on character strings
    

`name = "Alice"`  
`upper_name = name.upper()`  
`print(upper_name) # Output: ALICE`

### File Handling

- Reading from and writing to files
    

`with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:`  
`file.write("Hello, World!")`  
  
`with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:`  
`content = file.read()`  
`print(content) # Output: Hello, World!`

### Boolean Operators

- Logical operations
    

`x = 7`  
`y = 5`  
`is_valid = x > 5 and y < 10`  
`print(is_valid) # Output: True`

### Arithmetic Operators

- Basic mathematical operations
    

`x = 5`  
`y = 3`  
`sum_value = x + y`  
`product = x * y`  
`print(sum_value, product) # Output: 8, 15`

### Full example

- This script greets the user, asks for two numbers, and multiplies them if they are both greater than 10
    
- It gives the user three attempts to provide suitable numbers and asks if they want to continue after each attempt. Finally, it writes the greeting and the last multiplication result to a file
    

```python
# Constants
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3
FILENAME = 'output.txt'

# Subroutine to greet a user
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

# Subroutine to multiply two numbers
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Main program
def main():
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    print(greet(name))

    # Iteration to allow multiple attempts
    for attempt in range(MAX_ATTEMPTS):
        x = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
        y = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

        # Selection
        if x > 10 and y > 10:
            result = multiply(x, y)
            print(f"The product of {x} and {y} is {result}")
        else:
            print("Both numbers should be greater than 10.")

        # Asking user if they want to continue
        continue_choice = input("Do you want to continue? (y/n): ")
        if continue_choice.lower() != 'y':
            break

    # File Handling
    with open(FILENAME, 'w') as file:
        file.write(greet(name) + "\n")
        file.write(f"Last multiplication result: {result}")

    print(f"Results have been saved to {FILENAME}")

# Sequence: Calling the main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


#### Worked Example

**You are working for a library and need to develop a program that calculates the total late fees for overdue books. Provide pseudocode that includes a function to calculate the fee for each book.**

**How to answer this question:**

- Notice that the same operation needs to take place against multiple items. This suggests iteration could be used
    
- A function is required to calculate the fee for each book. Simple names for functions make them clear to understand
    
- Think of some data structures to hold the bits of data for this scenario
    
    - Many numbers representing each book's days overdue could be stored in an array
        
    - The total late fee could be stored in a variable
        
- Use indentation to show which code is inside a code block e.g. `function`, `if` statement, `for` statement
    
- **Only** include code comments where you think it's necessary to explain
    
- The example below contains comments for your understanding
    

**Answer:**

 **Answer that gets full marks:**

```javascript
const DAILY_CHARGE = 1 // Many functions can use this constant if they need it

function calculateFee(days_overdue) {
    if (days_overdue > 0) {
        return days_overdue * DAILY_CHARGE; // £1 per day
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

function calculateTotalFee(books) {
    let total_fee = 0;
    for (let days_overdue of books) { // days_overdue represents each item in books
        total_fee += calculateFee(days_overdue); // adding the result of the function to total_fee
    }
    return total_fee; // returning the variable back to the caller
}

let books = [7, 3, 0, 10]; // Array of numbers representing each book's overdue days
let total_fee = calculateTotalFee(books);
console.log("Total Late Fee:", total_fee);
```

- This solution contains a function that accepts an array of books and a function that calculates the fee for a single book.
- This is well-designed because two smaller functions are better than one larger function.
