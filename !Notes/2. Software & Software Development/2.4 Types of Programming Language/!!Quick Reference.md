[[!2.4 Types of Programming Language]]

**Key Programming Paradigms**

|Paradigm|Description|Examples of Key Concepts|
|---|---|---|
|Procedural|A structured programming style based on procedure calls.|Procedures, function calls|
|Object-Oriented|Organizes code around objects that combine data and functionality.|Classes, inheritance, polymorphism|
|Assembly|A low-level language that provides direct control over hardware.|Registers, mnemonics, opcodes|

**Key Features of Procedural Programming**

- **Variables**: Store data values that can change during program execution.
- **Constants**: Store values that remain unchanged throughout the program.
- **Selection**: Decision-making constructs that allow branching in code execution.
- **Iteration**: Loops that repeat actions until a condition is met.
- **Subroutines**: Reusable code blocks that can be called multiple times.

**Key Modes of Addressing**

- **Immediate Addressing**: Operand is part of the instruction itself.
- **Direct Addressing**: The memory address of the operand is directly specified.
- **Indirect Addressing**: A register contains the memory address of the operand.
- **Indexed Addressing**: Combines a base address with an index to compute the effective address.

**Facts to Memorize**

- Constants like PI = 3.1415
- Common assembly mnemonics: ADD, SUB, STA, LDA, BRA, BRZ, BRP, INP, OUT, HLT
- Basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
- Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT

**Concept Comparisons**

|Paradigm|Description|Examples of Languages|
|---|---|---|
|Procedural|Structured around procedure calls, emphasizes modular design.|C, Go, Rust|
|Object-Oriented|Organizes code around objects that combine data and functionality.|Java, C#, Swift|
|Assembly|Low-level representation of machine code, direct control over hardware.|x86-64 Assembly, ARMv8|

**Problem-Solving Steps**

**To solve a programming problem using procedural programming:**

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully.
2. **Identify Inputs and Outputs**: Determine what data you need and what the expected output is.
3. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable tasks or functions.
4. **Write Pseudocode**: Outline the logic in plain language before coding.
5. **Implement the Code**: Translate the pseudocode into the programming language.
6. **Test the Code**: Run the program with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.
7. **Debug**: Identify and fix any errors or issues that arise during testing.

**Key Terms/Concepts**

- **Programming Paradigm**: A fundamental style of computer programming that dictates how programs are structured and developed.
- **Procedural Programming**: A programming paradigm that follows a step-by-step approach, organizing code into procedures or functions.
- **Assembly Language**: A low-level programming language that provides a symbolic representation of a computer's machine code, allowing for direct hardware manipulation.
