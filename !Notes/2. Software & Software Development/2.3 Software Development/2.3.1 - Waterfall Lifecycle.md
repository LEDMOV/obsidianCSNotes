[[!2.3 Software Development]]

## Waterfall Lifecycle

The Waterfall Model is a sequential software development process divided into distinct phases. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins.

### Steps in the model:

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis:** All possible system requirements to be developed are captured and documented clearly
    
2. **System Design:** The requirements are translated into a design. Architects and designers define the overall architecture and identify the main components
    
3. **Implementation:** The actual code is written in this phase based on the design documents, turning the system design into a functional program
    
4. **Integration and Testing:** All the components and modules are integrated and tested to ensure that the entire system works as expected
    
5. **Deployment:** The product is released to the market or handed over to the client. It may involve installation, customization, and training
    
6. **Maintenance:** Post-release, the system needs regular maintenance to fix bugs, improve performance, or add new features

_**The Waterfall Model in Software Engineering**_

### Benefits:

- **Simple and linear:** Easy to understand and follow, with each stage progressing linearly to the next
    
- **Clear stages and milestones:** Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones, making progress easy to measure
    
- **Suitable for well-defined projects:** Works best when the requirements are clear and unlikely to change during development
    

### Drawbacks:

- **Inflexible:** Changes are difficult to implement once the project has started, as the model doesn't easily allow for revisiting previous stages
    
- **Expensive to fix late problems:** If a problem appears later in the development cycle, it can be costly and time-consuming to fix
    
- **Long development cycle:** The sequential nature may lead to a longer development time, especially if stages are delayed
    

### Suitability:

- **The Waterfall Model is most suitable for projects where requirements are well understood and unlikely to change.** It works well when high quality and compliance are essential, and there is a clear understanding of the project's goals and constraints
