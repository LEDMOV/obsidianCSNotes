## Agile (Extreme Programming)

Extreme Programming (XP) is a type of Agile software development methodology that promotes adaptability and high customer involvement.

### Steps in the model:

1. **Planning:** Customers and developers define the scope and priorities, including writing user stories
    
2. **Design:** Developers create a simple design for the system that can evolve over time
    
3. **Coding:** Coding is done in small increments with frequent integration and pair programming to ensure quality
    
4. **Testing:** Continuous testing throughout the coding process, with automated tests developed before or alongside the code
    
5. **Integration:** Regular and frequent integration of code, with continuous integration tools ensuring that the system works as a whole
    
6. **Feedback and Iteration:** Constant feedback from stakeholders is used to guide future development cycles, leading to iterative and incremental development

_**The Extreme Programming (Agile) Model**_

### Benefits:

- **Highly adaptable:** Can quickly respond to changes in requirements, even late in development
    
- **Frequent communication:** Encourages constant communication between team members and stakeholders
    
- **Quality focus:** Emphasizes technical excellence and good design, with continuous testing throughout the development cycle
    
- **Customer collaboration:** Encourages working closely with customers to ensure the developed product meets their needs
    

### Drawbacks:

- **Requires experienced team members:** Can be challenging to implement without knowledgeable and skilled developers
    
- **Intensive collaboration can lead to burnout:** The constant communication and collaboration can be tiring for team members
    
- **May lack documentation:** The focus on adaptability and immediate coding may result in insufficient documentation
    
- **Scope creep:** The flexible nature may lead to uncontrolled changes in requirements
    

### Suitability:

- **Extreme Programming is most suitable for small to medium-sized projects** where requirements can change and customer involvement is high
