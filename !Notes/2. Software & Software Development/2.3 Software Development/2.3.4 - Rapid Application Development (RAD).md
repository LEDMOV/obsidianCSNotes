## Rapid Application Development (RAD)

- Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that emphasises fast and iterative development
    

### Steps in the model:

1. **Requirement planning:** Gather general system requirements, define constraints and assumptions
    
2. **User design and prototyping:** Collaborate with users to develop prototypes, ensuring alignment with user needs
    
3. **Construction or iterative development:** Build the system incrementally, with continuous user feedback and adaptation
    
4. **Cutover or deployment:** Transition the product into the live environment, including user training, support, and documentation
    
5. **Maintenance and updates:** Continue to adapt and improve the system based on user feedback and needs

_**Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model of Software Development**_

### Benefits:

- **Speed:** Enables rapid development and delivery of a high-quality system at a relatively low investment cost
    
- **User involvement:** Clients are involved throughout the development process, ensuring that the system aligns with user needs and expectations
    
- **Flexibility:** Allows for changes and adaptations to be made quickly as requirements evolve
    
- **Incremental development:** Promotes development in small increments, with constant feedback and adaptation
    

### Drawbacks:

- **Dependent on strong team collaboration:** Requires skilled and collaborative team members, which can be a challenge to assemble
    
- **Potential lack of quality:** The focus on speed might lead to skipping rigorous testing or documentation, impacting the quality
    
- **Not suitable for small projects:** The intense collaboration and iterative approach might be overkill for simple or small-scale projects
    
- **Can lead to scope creep:** The flexible nature may lead to uncontrolled changes in requirements
    

### Suitability:

- Rapid Application Development is most suitable for projects where **rapid delivery is required** and where requirements can be developed and refined **on the go**
