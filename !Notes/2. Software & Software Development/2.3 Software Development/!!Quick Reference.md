[[!2.3 Software Development]]

**Key Suitability**

- **Waterfall Model**: Best for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.
- **Agile (XP)**: Ideal for small to medium-sized projects where requirements can change and customer involvement is high.
- **Spiral Model**: Most suitable for large, complex projects where requirements may change and risk management is essential.
- **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**: Suitable for projects requiring rapid delivery and where requirements can be developed and refined on the go.

**Facts to Memorize**

- **Waterfall Model phases**: Requirement Gathering, System Design, Implementation, Integration and Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
- **Agile (XP) phases**: Planning, Design, Coding, Testing, Integration, Feedback and Iteration.
- **Spiral Model phases**: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering, Evaluation and Feedback.
- **RAD phases**: Requirement Planning, User Design and Prototyping, Construction, Cutover, Maintenance.

**Key Terms/Concepts**

- **Waterfall Model**: A sequential software development process divided into distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- **Agile Programming**: A flexible software development methodology that promotes adaptability and high customer involvement, often exemplified by Extreme Programming (XP).
- **Spiral Model**: A software development methodology that combines iterative and sequential processes, focusing on risk assessment and customer feedback.
- **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**: A software development methodology emphasizing fast and iterative development with user involvement.
