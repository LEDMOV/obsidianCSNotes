## Device Drivers

### What is a Device Driver?

- A device driver is a piece of software that enables communication between an operating system and specific hardware devices such as:
    
    - Printers
        
    - Graphics cards
        
    - Network cards
        
- Device drivers allow the OS to **control and interact** with those devices
    
- Because many external devices have embedded system software, a driver **bridges the gap** between a major operating system and a tiny hardware OS
    
- Device drivers make it possible to **perform specific operations** on the hardware e.g. a printer driver enables the OS to send print commands and manage print jobs
    
- Most hardware manufacturers write their own device driver software, meaning a single operating system may have **several printer drivers** installed
    

#### Worked Example

**Adding a DVD drive to a computer often requires the installation of a piece of software called a device driver.**

**State the purpose of a device driver.**

[1]

**How to answer this question:**

- Pick one example of a hardware device and describe what happens between it and the operating system
    
- Explain that this is made possible through device driver software
    

**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

The purpose of a device driver is to enable the operating system to interact with and control a hardware device. For example, a printer would have an associated device driver so the OS could send or receive data from a printer system.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

The purpose of a device driver is to enable communication between an operating system and external hardware.
