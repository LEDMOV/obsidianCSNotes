## BIOS

### What does BIOS mean?

- BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System
    
- BIOS is a piece of **firmware** stored on a small memory chip on the motherboard
    
- On system start, the BIOS is the first software to run
    
- It performs a **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**, a diagnostic testing sequence that ensures all the hardware components are working properly
    
- If the BIOS encounters any errors during this test, it will either halt the boot process or issue an error message
    
- If the POST succeeds, the BIOS will run the **Bootstrap loading sequence**, which is the program responsible for starting the operating system
    

#### Worked Example

**In the late 1990s, the CIH virus hit the headlines because it could overwrite and destroy the contents of a computer’s BIOS.**

**Describe the effect of a computer having its BIOS overwritten.**

**How to answer this question:**

- Explain the role of BIOS in a computer system
    
- Explain the consequence of having a destroyed BIOS
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

The BIOS is crucial in initialising the hardware components and operating the system. If a virus, such as the CIH virus, overwrites or destroys the contents of a computer's BIOS, it will be unable to perform the Power-On Self-Test (POST) and fail to load the bootstrap program. This would mean the computer will not be able to initialise the operating system.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

If the BIOS has been overwritten, it will not be able to perform the Power-On Self-Test (POST) and, therefore, unable to load the bootstrap program. This would mean the operating system would fail to start.
