## Types of Operating System

### What is an OS?

- An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software that manages the computer hardware, provides common services for computer programs, and acts as an interface between users and the machine
    
- There are several different types of operating systems, each with unique characteristics and purposes
    
- Understanding these types is essential for both developing and using computer systems
    

### List of operating system types

| **Type**                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distributed** Operating Systems      | Run on multiple machines appearing as a single unit, used for efficient task distribution and load balancing                                                         |
| **Embedded** Operating Systems         | Designed for specific tasks, is the system running inside a device that is not primarily a computer system, e.g. microwave, dishwasher, washing machine              |
| **Multi-tasking** Operating Systems    | Allows multiple tasks to appear to run concurrently on a single processor, manages system resources and allocates CPU time to different processes                    |
| **Multi-user** Operating Systems       | Supports multiple users accessing computer resources concurrently, efficiently manages resource allocation, and provides features for data security and user privacy |
| **Real-Time** Operating Systems (RTOS) | Designed for immediate data processing, and can ensure tasks are processed in specific timeframes, highly efficient                                                  |

### Examples of each type

|**Type**|**Example**|
|---|---|
|**Distributed** Operating Systems|Hadoop is an **open-source** OS designed to process big data using multiple **nodes** in a distributed network.|
|**Embedded** Operating Systems|**IoT** devices and many household devices contain embedded OS. These devices don’t typically run a well-known OS. They run a proprietary OS that has a simple set of functions.|
|**Multi-Tasking** Operating Systems|Windows, MacOS, and Linux are multi-tasking OS that can run multiple applications simultaneously.|
|**Multi-User** Operating Systems|Windows, MacOS, and Linux are multi-user OSs where multiple users can log in and run independent processes.|
|**Real-Time** Operating Systems|Real-time OS are used in industries like aerospace and automotive where low **latency** is critical to safety.|

#### Worked Example

**A taxi firm is investigating replacing its drivers with self-driving cars.**

**Explain why the self-driving system will use a real-time operating system.**

**How to answer this question:**

- Be able to state the purpose of an operating system and recall the advantages of a real-time operating system
    
- Link the advantage to the scenario in the question
    

**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

A self-driving car system must process data in real-time from input sensors such as radar cameras. Data needs to be processed instantly so that the vehicle can operate safely. A vehicle that cannot process data quickly will be an unreliable danger to people. Faster processing of input data will lead to safer operation of the vehicle. A real-time system will replicate hazard perception, navigation, and vehicle control that humans can instinctively do.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

An operating system needs to process tasks quickly. A real-time operating system needs to process them instantly. A real-time operating system should be used in a self-driving car so that it can react to hazards quickly.

#### Worked Example

**A company releases an in-home virtual assistant called ‘Bertie Butler’. When placed in a room, the device listens out for the phrase “Hey Bertie”. When someone says that phrase, it listens to the following question and tries to give a relevant answer.**

**The Bertie Butler device runs off an embedded operating system.**

**Define the term ‘embedded operating system’.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**

- Recall the features of an embedded system
    
- Use the scenario to include examples in your answer
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

Embedded systems are those running inside everyday items that are not primarily computers. Embedded systems usually have a simple set of features that they perform efficiently. Some other embedded systems, such as microwaves, have much simpler features and functions.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

An embedded system runs in most household devices that require some processing e.g. microwaves, dishwashers, electric toothbrushes
