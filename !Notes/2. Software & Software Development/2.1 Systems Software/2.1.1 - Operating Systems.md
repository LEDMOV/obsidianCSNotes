## Operating Systems

### Why do we need Operating Systems?

- Operating systems are essential for managing the hardware and software resources of a computer system
    
- They provide an interface between the user and the hardware, allowing the user to interact with the system and run applications
    

### What are the main functions of an operating system?

- Operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, Android, Linux, iOS and Ubuntu have responsibilities that can be grouped into the following categories:
    
    - Resource management
        
    - File Management
        
    - Interrupt handling
        
    - Security
        
    - Providing a platform for software to run
        
    - Providing a user interface
        
    - Providing utilities
        

#### Resource Management

- Operating systems manage the computer's resources, including the CPU, memory, disk drives, and printers
    
- They allocate resources to specific tasks and ensure that they are used effectively
    
- e.g. when a user opens multiple applications simultaneously, the operating system decides:
    
    - How much memory to allocate to each application
        
    - When and for how long each gets to use the CPU
        
    - How to handle data being read from or written to the hard drive.
        

#### File Management

- Operating systems handle the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data files
    
- When working with files, operating systems provide a GUI of the file system that allows a user to decide which directory a file should be saved in and what the file name will be
    

#### Interrupt Handling

- Interrupt events require the immediate attention of the central processing unit
    
- In order to maintain the smooth running of the system, interrupts need to be handled and processed in a timely manner
    
- E.g. if a user clicks cancel on a file conversion process, a signal is sent from the mouse, interrupts the processor, and the operating system will trigger the cancellation routine
    

#### Security

- Operating systems provide various security features such as password-protected system accounts, a **firewall**, virus scanning and **file encryption**
    
- Password-protected system accounts are a very common feature in operating systems
    
- System accounts can also be restricted from performing certain actions, e.g. editing network settings, installing unapproved software, changing the account settings of other users
    

#### Providing a Platform for Software to Run

- Operating systems provide a platform on which application software can run, this is mainly by allowing software access to system resources
    
- e.g. if a computer game has intensive graphics and online play, the operating system will grant it access to the GPU and the network card

#### Providing a User Interface

- Operating systems provide interaction in 2 ways: visually through a graphical user interface (GUI) or text-based through a command-line interface (CLI)
    
- Most modern PC operating systems provide both options, and a user will prefer one over the other depending on the task
    
- Mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS provide GUIs that are suitable for interaction through touch
    
- Ubuntu is an OS popular with software engineers because it provides a no-frills GUI and an efficient CLI
    

#### Providing Utilities

- Utility programs help with system maintenance and security
    
- Some utility programs include: file encryption, file compression, disk defragmentation, system backup, disk cleanup
    
- File encryption allows users to send files over networks securely
    
- File compression reduces the size of a file, which helps send large files over a network
    
- Disk defragmentation physically reorganises files on the hard disk so they can be found and accessed faster
    
- Disk cleanup scans the hard disk for duplicate and corrupt files and deletes them to create more space on the disk
    
- Backup software allows users to restore their system to a point in history
    

#### Worked Example

**Operating systems usually come with utility software pre-installed.**

**Give two examples of utility software, explaining the purpose of both.**

[4]

**How to answer this question:**

- You need to name two different examples of utility software and the purpose of each:
    
    - **Backup software:** creates system snapshots and will restore them on demand
        
    - **Disk defragmentation**: reorganises the hard disk so that files are better organised
        
    - **File compression**: reduces file size to consume less hard disk space or for faster transfer over a network
        
    - **Disk cleanup**: finds and removes duplicate or corrupted files, freeing up hard disk space
        
    - **File encryption**: Encodes files before transfer, will decode files that have been received
        
- For each utility, include why it's helpful in your answer
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

1. Disk defragmentation is a utility that will better organise files on the hard disk so that the operating system can access them more efficiently. Better organised files will lead to a smoother operation of the system.
    
2. File encryption software will encode the contents of a file into a non-readable format. If files containing sensitive data are lost or stolen, the contents will be protected from misuse.
    

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

1. Disk cleanup will scan the hard disk for duplicate files and remove them.
    
2. Backup software will allow users to restore a system to a previous point.
