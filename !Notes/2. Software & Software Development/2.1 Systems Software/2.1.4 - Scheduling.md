## Scheduling

### What is Scheduling? 

- Deciding **which tasks** to process, for **how long**, and in **what order** is achieved through scheduling algorithms
    
- A CPU is responsible for processing tasks as fast as possible
    
- Different algorithms are used to prioritise and process tasks that need CPU time
    
- The algorithms have different uses, benefits and drawbacks.
    

### Scheduling categories

- **Preemptive**: allocates the CPU for **time-limited slots**
    
- **Non-preemptive**: allocates the CPU to tasks for **unlimited time slots**
    

#### Preemptive Scheduling

- Allocates the CPU for a specific **time quantum** to a process
    
- Allows interruption of processes currently being handled
    
- It can result in low-priority processes being neglected if high-priority processes arrive frequently
    
- Example algorithms include **Round Robin** and **Shortest Remaining Time First** 
    

#### Non-Preemptive Scheduling

- Once the CPU is allocated to a process, the process holds it until it completes its **burst time** or switches to a 'waiting' state
    
- A process cannot be interrupted unless it completes or its burst time is reached
    
- If a process with a long burst time is running, shorter processes will be neglected
    
- Example algorithms include **First Come First Serve** and **Shortest Job First**
    

### Scheduling Algorithms

#### Round robin (RR)

- RR is a pre-emptive algorithm, equally distributing processor time amongst all processes
    
- Each process is given a **time quantum** to execute
    
- Processes that are ready to be worked on get queued
    
- If a process hasn’t been completed by the end of its time quantum, it will be moved to the back of the queue

#### First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)

- FCFS is non-preemptive, prioritising processes that arrive at the queue first
    
- The process currently being worked on will block all other processes until it is complete
    
- All new tasks join the back of the queue

#### Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

- MLFQ is a pre-emptive priority algorithm where shorter and more critical tasks are processed first
    
- Multiple queues are used so that tasks of equal size are grouped together
    
- All processes will join the highest priority queue but will trickle down to lower priority queues if they exceed the time quantum

#### Shortest job first (SJF)

- SJF is non-preemptive, where all processes are continuously sorted by burst time from shortest to longest
    
- When new processes arrive on the queue, they are prioritised based on their burst time in the next cycle
    
- Shorter jobs are placed at the front of the priority queue
    
- Longer jobs have lower priority, so they are placed at the back

_**Shortest job first scheduling algorithm**_

#### Shortest remaining time first (SRTF)

- SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF, where processes with the shortest remaining time are higher priority
    
- Time quantum is set, and if a task doesn’t complete in time, it will be re-queued for further processing
    
- Before the next cycle starts, all processes are inspected and ordered by the shortest remaining time to complete

### Comparison and Summary of Scheduling Algorithms

|**Algorithm**|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|---|
|**Round Robin**|All processes get a fair share of the CPU<br><br>Good for time-sharing systems<br><br>Predictable, as every process gets equal time|Choosing the right time quantum can be difficult<br><br>This can lead to a high turnaround time and waiting time for long processes|
|**First Come, First Served**|Simple and easy to understand<br><br>Fair in the sense that processes are served in the order they arrive|This can lead to poor performance if a long process arrives before shorter processes<br><br>High-priority tasks wait for their turn in the queue|
|**Multi-Level Feedback Queues**|Smaller tasks are prioritised<br><br>Creates a prioritisation system where similar-sized tasks are queued together|More complex than other algorithms<br><br>Setting the correct parameters (e.g., number of queues, ageing rules) can be complex|
|**Shortest Job First**|Minimises waiting time<br><br>Efficient and fast for short processes|Requires knowing the burst time of processes in advance<br><br>Long processes can starve if short processes keep arriving|
|**Shortest Time Remaining**|Ideal for jobs that have shorter burst times<br><br>It is preemptive, so it can be aligned with CPU for best performance (time quantum)|Like SJF, it requires knowing the burst time of processes in advance<br><br>High context switching overhead due to preemption|

- The suitability of a scheduling algorithm largely depends on the specific scenario and the system requirements
    
- A drawback in one scenario may not be a drawback in another
    

#### Worked Example

**A company makes anti-virus software. When running anti-virus software, an operating system uses a scheduling algorithm to allocate CPU time to the anti-virus software.**

**Explain why a First Come First Served scheduling algorithm would not be suitable in this situation.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**

- Think of the conditions that anti-virus software runs optimally
    
- Recall the way the FCFS algorithm works and its benefits and drawbacks
    
- Link how the optimal running of anti-virus is incompatible with FCFS scheduling
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

Anti-virus software is high-priority because it scans the operating system constantly, looking for threats. When a threat is detected, anti-virus will quarantine or eliminate them. To work effectively, anti-virus software needs high-priority access to CPU time.

Using FCFS could delay these critical tasks if many other processes are in the queue ahead of the anti-virus software. Other less crucial tasks could get CPU time before the anti-virus process, leading to potential security risks.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

The FCFS algorithm is unsuitable because essential antivirus processing would be placed at the back of the queue and wait for its turn.  Lower-priority tasks would use valuable CPU time, meaning the system could be at risk.



**Arnold has a router. It will receive data packets from other computers on Arnold's network or the internet and then route them to the next step.**

**The scheduling algorithm Arnold's router uses is First Come First Served.**

**(iii) Explain why first come, first served is a suitable scheduling algorithm for Arnold's router**
