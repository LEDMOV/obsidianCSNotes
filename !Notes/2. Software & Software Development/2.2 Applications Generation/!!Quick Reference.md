[[!2.2 Applications Generation]]

Key Types of Application Software

|Type|Purpose|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Word Processor|For creating, editing, formatting, and printing text documents.|Microsoft Word, Google Docs|
|Database Management|For storing, retrieving, and managing data.|MySQL, Oracle|
|Web Browser|For browsing the web and accessing information online.|Google Chrome, Firefox|
|Graphics Manipulation|For editing and manipulating images and graphic designs.|Adobe Photoshop, GIMP|
|Spreadsheet Software|For organizing, calculating, and analyzing numerical data.|Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets|

Key Stages of Compilation

|Stage|Description|
|---|---|
|Lexical Analysis|Identifies tokens in the source code, ignoring whitespace and comments.|
|Syntax Analysis|Ensures tokens adhere to the syntax rules of the programming language and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).|
|Code Generation|Generates object code from the AST that can be executed by the computer.|
|Optimisation|Modifies the code to improve efficiency without changing its functionality.|

Key Types of Translators

- **Interpreters**: Execute source code line-by-line, allowing for easier debugging but slower overall execution.
- **Compilers**: Translate the entire source code into machine code at once, resulting in faster execution but longer initial compilation time.
- **Assemblers**: Convert assembly language into machine code, dealing with low-level languages.

Key People

- **Linus Torvalds**: Creator of the Linux operating system and a prominent figure in the open-source movement.
- **Richard Stallman**: Founder of the Free Software Foundation and advocate for free software and open-source principles.

Facts to Memorize

Problem-Solving Steps

To recommend application software based on a scenario:

1. Read the scenario carefully to identify user tasks.
2. Identify two or more software applications that can complete these tasks.
3. Write your recommendation, clearly stating how the features of the applications meet the user needs.

Key Terms/Concepts

- **Application Software**: Software designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processing or database management.
- **Utility Software**: Software designed to help manage, maintain, and optimize computer systems, supporting the operating system.
- **Open Source Software (OSS)**: Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
- **Closed Source Software (CSS)**: Software with proprietary source code that is not shared with the public.
- **Translators**: Programs that convert source code from high-level programming languages to low-level machine code, including interpreters, compilers, and assemblers.
