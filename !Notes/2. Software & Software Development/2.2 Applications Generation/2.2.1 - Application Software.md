## Application Software

### What are Applications?

- Applications are software designed to perform a specific task or tasks for a user
    
- Application types include word processors, database management, web browsers, graphics manipulation, games and many more
    
- Application software enables users to perform tasks like creating documents, managing data, and surfing the web
    

### Common types of application software

|**Type**|**Purpose**|**Examples**|
|---|---|---|
|**Word Processor**|For creating, editing, formatting and printing text documents.|Microsoft Word, Google Docs|
|**Database Management Software**|For storing, retrieving, manipulating and managing data.|MySQL, Oracle|
|**Web Browser**|For browsing the web and accessing information online.|Google Chrome, Firefox|

#### Examiner Tip

Exam questions on this topic typically present a scenario and then require a recommendation of suitable software.

**How to recommend an application:**

1. Carefully read the scenario and identify the specific tasks the user must perform
    
2. Identify two or more software applications that have features to complete these tasks
    
3. Write your recommendation and clearly state how the application feature helps achieve the user needs from the scenario
    

#### Worked Example

**'Bee Bank' is a new online bank launching next year. The directors of the bank have set a target to open 10,000 new accounts in the first month. To open accounts for new customers, the bank needs to write to them by letter and store their data somewhere.**

**Recommend two types of application software for the bank and explain your choice.**

**How to answer this question:**

- Identify user tasks from the scenario
    
- Recall software applications that would assist in completing these tasks
    
- Clearly state what feature about the application helps the user achieve these tasks
    

**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

For Bee Bank, I recommend the following two types of application software:

- Word Processor: A word processor like Microsoft Word is ideal for creating, editing, formatting, and printing letters, meeting the bank's need to communicate with new customers.
    
- Database Management System (DBMS): A DBMS like Oracle Database offers robust data management features, including secure data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, meeting the bank's need to hold and manage customer data.
    

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

For the new bank, I recommend using a Word Processor such as Microsoft Word to create letters to send to customers and a Database Management System (DBMS) like Oracle Database to securely store and manage customer data.
