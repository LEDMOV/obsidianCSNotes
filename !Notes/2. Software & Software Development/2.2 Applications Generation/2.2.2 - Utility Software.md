## Utility Software

### What is Utility Software?

- Utility software is designed to help analyse, configure, optimise, or maintain a computer
    
- It **supports** the operating system, which is different to application software that performs tasks that benefit end-users
    

|**Utility Software**|**Purpose**|**Role**|**Examples/Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Disk Defragmentation**|To rearrange the files on a hard drive to increase efficiency|By putting files into contiguous blocks and minimizing empty spaces, disk defragmentation speeds up file access and can improve overall system performance|Modern SSDs generally don't require defragmentation|
|**File Management**|To organize, search, rename, and relocate files stored on the system|Includes creating, deleting, moving, and renaming files and folders|Windows Explorer, macOS Finder|
|**Device Driver**|To provide an interface between the hardware and the operating systems|Ensures that the OS and programs can communicate with the hardware without needing to know the hardware's precise details|The OS usually manages drivers, but users may sometimes need to update them|
|**System Cleanup**|To free up space on the system by removing unnecessary files and data|System cleanup utilities remove temporary files, system cache, unused applications, and other "junk" that can slow down the system|CCleaner, Disk Cleanup on Windows|
|**Security**|To protect the computer system from various threats like viruses, malware, and spyware|Monitors the system and controls the computer's activities to protect it from threats|Norton, McAfee, Windows Defender|

#### Worked Example

**Operating systems usually come with utility software pre-installed. Give two examples of utility software, explaining the purpose of both.**

**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

Disk defragmentation is a utility that will better organise files on the hard disk so that the operating system can access them more efficiently. Better organised files will lead to a smoother operation of the system.

File encryption software enables users to transfer sensitive data files over a network securely. A simple encryption utility will request a password from the user and scramble the file's contents. The file contents will only be reassembled in the correct order if the receiver knows the password.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

Disk defragmentation rearranges files on a computer's hard disk to make it run more smoothly. File encryption software lets users send private files safely by scrambling the contents, and only someone with valid permission can unscramble them.
