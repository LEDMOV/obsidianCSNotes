## Stages of Compilation

### What is Compilation?

- **Compilation** is a process that translates a program written in a high-level programming language into machine code
    
- Only machine code can be executed by a computer
    
- There are four stages involved in this process:
    
    - Lexical Analysis
        
    - Syntax Analysis
        
    - Code Generation
        
    - Optimisation
        

### Lexical Analysis

- Lexical analysis means studying the **words or vocabulary** of a language
    
- This stage involves identifying lexical 'tokens' in the code
    
- Tokens represent small meaningful units in the programming language, such as:  
    
    - Keywords
        
        - var, const, function, for, while, if
            
    - Identifiers
        
        - Variable names, function names
            
    - Operators
        
        - '+', '++', '-', '*'
            
    - Separators
        
        - ',' ';', '{', '}', '(', ')'
            

- During this stage, unnecessary elements like comments and whitespace are ignored
    
- For example, if the following code is being compiled:
    

`var x = function(x,y) {`

`if(x>2) {`

`return x*y;`

`}`

`return x+y;`  
`}`

- The result of lexical analysis is a **token table**

### Syntax Analysis

- Now that tokens have been identified, syntax analysis makes sure they all **adhere to the syntax rules** of the programming language
    
- A symbol, e.g. '$' could be a valid token but not a valid character according to particular programming languages
    
- The dollar symbol would be flagged as breaking the syntax rules
    
- Other syntax errors programmers commonly make include **mismatched parentheses** or **missing semicolons**
    
- If the code passes the syntax analysis, the compiler can create an **Abstract Syntax Tree** (AST)
    
- An AST is a graph-based representation of the code being compiled
    
- An AST is an efficient way to represent the code for the next step
    

### Example abstract syntax tree

- For the same code as above, the following abstract syntax tree can be created

### Code Generation

- This step takes the AST and traverses it to generate **object code** that can be executed by the computer
    

### Optimisation

- This step modifies the code to make it more efficient without changing its functionality
    
- This is important to attempt because it reduces the memory required to run the code, which leads to faster execution
    
- A common optimisation action is removing duplicate code
    
- If an 'add' function is written twice in the source code, a sophisticated compiler will notice this and include it only once in the object code
    

#### Worked Example

**Imogen is writing application software for her company and is ready to compile it.**

`const celsius = (fahrenheit) => {   return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32); }`

**Referring to the example above, explain what happens during Lexical Analysis.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**

- Recall the purpose of lexical analysis and what it aims to produce
    
- Recall the different types of tokens that can be identified in the code
    
- Use examples from the code block to write your answer
    

**Answer:**

 **Answer that gets full marks:**

'Lexical analysis' breaks the code into tokens, ignoring whitespace and comments. Tokens are identified by their type:

- keyword: 'return'
    
- operator: '*', '-'
    
- identifier: celsius, fahrenheit
    
- delimiter: ';', '(', ')' etc
    

When all tokens have been identified, a token table is produced for the next step in the compilation.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

The compiler will look at all the lexical tokens in the code e.g. 'fahrenheit' is an identifier, 'return' is a keyword. All the tokens are placed into a tokens table for the next step.

#### Worked Example

**State the name of the stage of compilation that directly follows Lexical Analysis.**
