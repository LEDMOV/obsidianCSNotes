## Open Source & Closed Source Software

- Think of software like a recipe. It's a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do
    
- **Open Source Software (OSS)** is like a **shared recipe**. Anyone can look at it, change it, or share it with others. It's all about community and collaboration
    
- **Closed Source Software (CSS)** is like a **secret recipe** that only particular chefs know. People can taste the dish at a restaurant but can't see the exact ingredients or change the recipe. This is how closed-source software works; the instructions are kept secret
    
- Knowing a little bit about these two types of software can help in understanding what's happening behind the scenes and in making better choices about the software that is used

#### Worked Example

**Imogen installs a compiler for a high-level programming language onto her computer and makes use of an open-source** **IDE****.**

**State what is meant by the term ‘open source software'.**


**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

Open Source Software is where the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. This means that anyone can view, access, and modify the code.

#### Worked Example

**Give one benefit to Imogen of using an open-source IDE rather than a closed source IDE.**


**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

One benefit to using an open-source IDE is the ability to customise the IDE according to her specific needs. This level of customisation is typically not available in closed-source software, where the source code is proprietary and can't be altered by the end user.
