## Libraries, Linkers & Loaders

### What are code libraries?

- **Definition**: A code library is a collection of pre-written code, classes, procedures, scripts, configurations, and more. They are packaged together to allow developers to perform common tasks without having to write code from scratch.
    

### How are libraries used?

- **Inclusion**: Libraries can be included in your code, providing functionalities that are already implemented
    
- **Standard Libraries**: Most programming languages come with standard libraries that offer basic functionalities
    
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Developers also have access to libraries created by others, often shared through package managers
    

### Benefits of using libraries

- **Efficiency**: Saves time and effort, as you don't need to write everything from scratch
    
- **Reliability**: Often tested and optimized, reducing the chance of errors
    
- **Reusability**: The same library can be used in different parts of the project or in different projects
    
- **Community Support**: Popular libraries often have strong community support and documentation
    

### Drawbacks of using libraries

- **Dependency Issues**: Relying on a third-party library can lead to problems if the library is discontinued or not maintained
    
- **Compatibility**: There might be compatibility issues with different versions of the library or the system you are working on
    
- **Overhead**: Using a large library for a small task can add unnecessary complexity and size to the application
    

### How libraries are used to write programs

- **Practical Application**: Regularly using libraries can enhance programming skills and enable the development of more complex and efficient programs
    
- **Best Practices**: Knowing when and how to use libraries properly is key to maximizing their benefits
    

### Libraries During Compilation

- **Compilation Process**: Libraries are often compiled separately and then linked to the code during the compilation process
    
- **Static Linking**: Libraries are combined with the code at compile time, creating a larger executable
    
- **Dynamic Linking**: Libraries are linked at runtime, allowing for more flexibility but requiring the library to be present during execution
    

### Role of Linkers and Loaders

- **Linkers**: These combine different code files and libraries into a single executable. They resolve references between files, ensuring everything points where it should
    
- **Loaders**: These are system tools that load executable files into memory so they can be run by the operating system

#### Worked Example

**When Imogen creates programs in a high-level language, she uses libraries.**

**Explain what a library means, giving one example of when one may be used.**

[3]

**How to answer this question:**

- Provide a clear definition of a library in programming
    
- Offer an example related to any programming language
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

A library in programming is a collection of pre-written functions and procedures that developers can incorporate to simplify their work. Imogen might use the JavaScript library 'Lodash' when working on complex data manipulation within an application. Lodash offers utility functions that streamline working with arrays, objects, strings, and more, enhancing code readability and efficiency.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

A library is a set of reusable code modules in programming. Imogen might use Lodash for a single string manipulation task in her project, which could simplify that task but might be considered overkill if the rest of the library's functionalities are not utilised.

#### Worked Example

**Describe one advantage of the use of library files to programmers.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**

- Describe one clear and specific advantage of using library files in programming
    
- Provide an example to highlight the benefit.
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

One advantage of using library files is that they save significant development time by providing pre-written and well-tested code functions, such as data manipulation functions in the Lodash library.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

Using library files can standardize development, making code more readable and maintainable, but it may introduce unnecessary complexity if the library is too extensive for the task.

#### Worked Example

**Describe one disadvantage of the use of library files to programmers.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**

- Describe one specific disadvantage of using library files in programming.
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**  
One disadvantage of library files is that they can add unnecessary complexity, mainly if an extensive library is used for a minor functionality, like using Lodash for just one function.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

Using library files might lead to dependency issues, potentially causing problems if the library becomes unsupported or incompatible.

#### Worked Example

**Explain how linkers are used during the compilation process.**

[3]

**How to answer this question:**

- Explain the role of linkers in the compilation process, focusing on their main function.
    

**Answer:**

**Example answer that gets full marks:**

Linkers are used to combine object files and libraries into a single executable file. They resolve symbols between these files and link them together, enabling separate compilation and creating a final program that can be run by the system.

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

Linkers connect object files into a final executable, allowing for modular programming and utilisation of reusable code, but may complicate dependency management.
