## Translators

### What is a Translator?

- Translators convert source code from a high-level language to a low-level language
    
- There are three main types of translators
    
    - Interpreters
        
    - Compilers
        
    - Assemblers
        

### Interpreters

- Interpret source code **line-by-line** and **executes it on the fly**
    
- Easier to debug, allows incremental testing, and is generally **faster to start execution**
    
- **Slower execution time** overall and requires the interpreter to be present during the execution


### Compilers

- Translates the **entire source code into machine code** at once and then executes it
    
- **Faster execution time**, no need for the compiler during execution
    
- **Longer initial compilation time** and can be more challenging to debug
    
- **Creates a .exe file**

### Assemblers

- Assemblers translate **assembly language** into machine code
    
- Unlike interpreters and compilers that work with high-level languages, assemblers deal with low-level languages
    
- The diagram below shows examples of programming languages, from low-level to high-level

_**Levels of Abstraction in Programming Languages**_

### Translators used for common languages

|**Programming Language**|**Translator**|
|---|---|
|C|Compiler|
|C++|Compiler|
|Java|Compiler|
|Python|Interpreter|
|JavaScript|Interpreter|
|Ruby|Interpreter|
|Swift|Compiler|
|Assembly Language|Assembler|
|PHP|Interpreter|

### Why do different languages have different translators? (non-syllabus content)

- **Level of Abstraction**
    
    - High-level languages like **Python** or **JavaScript** are **further from machine language** and often use interpreters to allow more **flexibility** and **ease of development**
        
    - Low-level languages like **C** or **Assembly** are **closer to machine code** and typically use compilers or assemblers for **efficiency**
        
- **Execution Model**
    
    - Languages like **C** and **C++** are compiled into machine code specific to a **target platform**
        
    - This allows for optimisations to make the code run more **efficiently**
        
    - But the code is generally **not portable** between different platforms
        
    - Languages like **Python** and **JavaScript** are interpreted, meaning they are translated line-by-line at runtime **on any platform**
        
    - This provides **greater portability**, as the same code can run on different platforms
        
    - This may **sacrifice some performance** compared to compiled code
        
- **Development Paradigm**
    
    - Interpreted languages allow determining variable types at runtime, which makes development faster
        
        - e.g. `var x = 5` (Interpreter will calculate `x` to be a number at runtime)
            
    - Compiled languages enforce stricter type-checking at compile time, which requires additional work across the project
        
        - e.g. `String var name = 'Michael';` (Compiler will demand that `name` has a data type before compiling)
            

#### Worked Example

**The program below is written in assembly code using the Little Man Computer instruction set. It is supposed to take in two numbers and output the higher.**

`INP STA NUMA INP STA NUMB SUB NUMA BRP NOTA LDA NUMB BRA QUIT NOTA LDA NUMA QUIT OUT HLT NUMA DAT NUMB DAT`

**State what type of translator program would be needed to convert the code above into machine code.**
