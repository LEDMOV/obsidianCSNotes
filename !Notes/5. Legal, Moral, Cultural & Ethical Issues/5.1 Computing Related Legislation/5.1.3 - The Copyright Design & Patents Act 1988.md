## The Copyright Designs & Patents Act 1988

### What is the Copyright Designs & Patents Act?

- This protects the **intellectual property** of an individual or a company
    
- It makes it illegal to copy, modify or distribute software or other intellectual property without the relevant **permission**
    
- If **original work** is original, **copyright** will be automatically applied and will not expire until 25 - 70 years from the death of the creator depending on the type of work
    
- If an individual believes that their work has been copied it is their responsibility to take action under the **Copyright Designs and Patents Act**
    
- Many sites online offer free downloads of copyrighted **software/videos** which prevents the intellectual copyright holder from earning their income on the work they have created
    
    - E.g. If someone downloaded videos from Netflix and shared them with others, they would be breaching the act
        
- The act covers videos and audio where **peer-to-peer streaming** prevents a copyright owner from receiving an income

#### Examiner Tip

- Make sure that you specify that the Copyright Design and Patents Act covers original work and is automatically applied from the creation of the work, then talk about what this means for the distribution of the work. For example:
    
    - _The work was protected by the Copyright Designs and Patents act when it was created. Therefore if anyone wishes to distribute it they have to gain the owner’s permission, if they just posted it to the internet then this would be in breach of the act._ 
        
- Also when referring to the name of the act, ensure you use its full name (The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act). It's not called the Copyright Act. If you use a shortened version it may cost you marks in the exam
