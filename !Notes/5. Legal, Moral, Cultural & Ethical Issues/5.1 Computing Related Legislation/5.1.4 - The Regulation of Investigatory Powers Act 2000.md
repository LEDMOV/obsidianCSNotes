[[!5.1 Computing Related Legislation]]

## The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

### What is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers?

- The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) legislates as to how organisations can monitor electronic communications
    
- The **RIPA** covers **investigation**, **surveillance** and **interception** of communication by public bodies
    
    - E.g. MI6 can legally wiretap online conversations in the interests of national security provided that a warrant has been issued
        
- Certain actions require government approval
    
- Different organisations have different limits on what they can do (GCHQ is amongst those that have most freedom)
    
- The Act enforces **internet service providers (ISPs)** and mobile phone companies to give up information on request from an authorised authority and to ensure that their networks have sufficient hardware installed to facilitate surveillance about a person
    
- This Act is particularly controversial as its powers also extend to small agencies like local councils
    
- Some people feel that the Act is an invasion of **privacy** or that it is used improperly
    
- There have been examples of this Act being used for reasons other than monitoring criminal or terrorist activities including monitoring cockle fisherman, fly tippers, and even a family to work out whether they lived in the catchment area of a local school
    

### Rights & Impact on Organisations 

With the increase in criminal and terrorist activities on the internet this act allows the Police and other public bodies to:

- Demand ISPs to provide access to a customer’s communications
    
    - This means that ISPs have to implement hardware and software which facilitates the surveillance of digital communications
        
- Allows mass surveillance of communications
    
- Demands access to be granted to protected information
    
    - Businesses have to provide access to digital communications or data when asked for
        
    - They have to implement hardware and software solutions that facilitates the storage of digital communications
        
- Allowing monitoring of an individual’s internet activities
    
- Prevents the existence of such interception activities being revealed in court
    

#### Case Study

[British Councils used RIPA to secretly spy on public (External link to](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public) [theguardian.com](http://theguardian.com/)[)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public)

- In 2016 an investigation was completed after councils were given permission to carry out more than 55,000 days of covert surveillance over 5 years which included people walking dogs, feeding pigeons and fly-tipping
    
- A freedom of information request has found that 186 local authorities, two-thirds of those that responded, used RIPA to gather evidence by secret listening devices, cameras and private detectives
    

#### Examiner Tip

- When you are asked to describe the RIPA you need to specify the technical terms "surveillance" and "communication" and don’t generalise them
    
- **Surveillance** is the use of technology to gather information on people, and the **communication** is done electronically
