[[!5.2 Moral & Ethical Issues]]

## Personal Information Ethics

### How is Personal Information Analysed Using Computers?

- Computers play a critical role in analysing personal information, particularly in areas such as healthcare, where medical records are involved
    
- The process involves data gathering, storage, and analysis, where various technologies and techniques are implemented
    

#### Data mining

- This involves extracting patterns from large data sets
    
- In the healthcare context, it can help in predicting disease trends and identifying at-risk demographics
    

#### Machine learning

- Machine learning algorithms can predict patient outcomes, assess risks, and personalize patient treatment plans based on past data
    

#### Artificial intelligence

- AI is used to process large amounts of data and make predictions or recommendations
    
- E.g. AI can analyse medical images to detect diseases or anomalies
    

### Impact of Analysing Personal Information

- As computers become increasingly pivotal in managing and analysing personal information, such as medical records, there arise consequential moral, social, ethical, and cultural implications
    
- These implications call for careful consideration and the establishment of comprehensive frameworks and guidelines to safeguard individuals' rights and privacy
    

### Moral implications

#### Consent & autonomy

- From a moral standpoint, obtaining informed consent from individuals before gathering, storing, and analysing their personal information is crucial
    
- Consent respects the autonomy of individuals to control information about themselves
    

#### Equity

- There is a moral obligation to ensure that the benefits derived from analysing personal information, such as improved healthcare outcomes, are distributed equitably and do not disproportionately favour specific groups
    

### Social implications

#### Privacy

- Personal information, particularly health data, is sensitive
    
- The use of computers to manage this data increases the risk of privacy breaches with significant social implications
    

#### Digital divide

- The digital divide refers to the disparity between individuals who have access to technology and those who do not
    
- The use of computers in managing health data may inadvertently exclude those who lack access to digital technology, leading to social inequity
    

### Ethical implications

#### Data security

- Given the sensitive nature of personal information, there is an ethical obligation to protect this data from breaches, theft, or misuse
    

#### Transparency & accountability

- Organisations must be transparent about how personal information is used and be held accountable for any misuse of the data
    
- This necessitates robust auditing mechanisms
    

### Cultural implications

#### Cultural sensitivity

- The use of personal information should respect cultural norms and practices
    
- E.g. some cultures have specific beliefs about health and privacy that must be respected when gathering and analysing their health data
    

#### Representation

- **There is a risk that certain cultural groups may be underrepresented in data sets, leading to biased outcomes**
    
- Efforts must be made to ensure fair representation of all cultural groups in the data-gathering process
    

#### Case Study

#### AI screening breast cancer images

- A Swedish study suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) can effectively read breast cancer screening images
    
- The research, led by Lund University, found that AI could detect cancer at a rate similar to two radiologists
    
- The study involved over 80,000 women, with AI-supported screening identifying cancer in 244 women, compared to 203 identified through standard screening
    
- Significantly, AI did not increase the rate of "false positives"
    
- Experts believe AI could help address radiologist shortages and improve efficiency in breast cancer screening
    
- However, more research is needed to understand its potential and cost-effectiveness fully
