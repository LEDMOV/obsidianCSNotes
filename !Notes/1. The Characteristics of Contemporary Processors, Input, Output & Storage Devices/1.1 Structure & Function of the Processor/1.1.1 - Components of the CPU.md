## Components of the CPU

### What is the CPU?

- The **CPU** is responsible for processing all data within the computer
    
- It is made up of a number of **components** including:
    
    - Arithmetic and Logic Unit (**ALU**)
        
    - Control Unit (**CU**)
        
    - **Registers** are temporary storage/memory locations inside the CPU which are used for a single specific purpose. They have a faster access speed than RAM / secondary storage. There are a number of registers in the CPU:
        
        - Program Counter (**PC**)
            
        - Accumulator (**ACC**)
            
        - Memory Address Register (**MAR**)
            
        - Memory Data Register (**MDR**)
            
        - Current Instruction Register (**CIR**)

|**Component**|**Function**|
|---|---|
|**Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**|This performs any arithmetic calculations (e.g. adding binary) or any logic comparisons (using AND, OR, NOT)<br><br>The ALU is made up of several components|
|**Control Unit**|This is where instructions are decoded. The CU also controls the data within the CPU and how it moves around|
|**Program Counter (PC)**|This stores the address in memory of the next instruction to be fetched|
|**Accumulator (ACC)**|This is where values are stored temporarily, either after they’ve been inputted or loaded, or after being calculated in the ALU|
|**Memory Address Register (MAR)**|This is where addresses are stored, either for where data is being sent in memory, or where it is being fetched from|
|**Memory Data Register (MDR)**|This is where data/instructions are stored, either before it sent to memory, or after being fetched|
|**Current Instruction Register (CIR)**|When an instruction has been fetched from memory it is loaded here before being split into opcode and operand. After this, it will be decoded.|

  
The ALU is made up of several components:

- **Arithmetic circuit**
    
    - This carries out any arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division)
        
- **Logic circuit**
    
    - This carries out operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR
        
- **Registers**
    
    - These are additional registers to those mentioned above and can store data
        
- **Status flags**
    
    - This includes overflow flags (if the value is too large for the register) or could include a zero flag (to tell if the answer is 0 easily)
        
- **Buses**
    
    - These are used to transport data around the ALU and to other parts of the CPU
        

## Buses

- There are 3 buses which connect the **CPU** with the main memory (**RAM**):
    
    - **Data bus**
        
    - **Address bus**
        
    - **Control bus**
        

|**Bus**|**Purpose**|**Operation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Bus**|Holds data being sent to/from the CPU and RAM|Read/Write|
|**Address Bus**|Holds addresses being sent to/from the CPU and RAM|Read/Write|
|**Control Bus**|Sends Signals to determine whether the other buses are in read or write mode|Sends signals|

- There are also a number of other buses within the CPU which transport data between the different areas
