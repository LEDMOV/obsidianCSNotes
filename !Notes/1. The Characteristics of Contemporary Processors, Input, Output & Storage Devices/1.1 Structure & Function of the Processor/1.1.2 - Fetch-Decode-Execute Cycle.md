[[!1.1 Structure & Function of the Processor]]

## Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

### What is the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle?

- The fetch-decode-execute cycle is the process that the CPU goes through repeatedly to process instructions
    
- There are **3 stages**:
    
    - **Fetching** an instruction from memory - supplying the address and receiving the instruction from memory
        
    - **Decoding** the instruction - interpreting the instruction and then reading and retrieving the required data from their addresses
        
    - **Executing** the instruction - the CPU carries out the required action
        

#### Examiner Tip

- You’ll need to know how to write [assembly language](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/2-software-and-software-development/2-4-types-of-programming-language/assembly-language/) using the **Little Man Computer** instruction set but now we’re just covering how the registers are used in assembly language
    

### Which Registers are Used in the CPU During the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle?

In the section below registers and CPU components appear in **bold** and assembly language is in _italics_

During the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle, the following steps happen:

- **Fetch**
    
    - The **PC** is loaded with 0
        
    - The value from the **PC** (0) is copied to the **MAR**
        
    - The data from the **MAR** (0) is sent across the address bus with the instruction to read the data sent across the control bus
        
    - The data from that location in memory (0) is sent down the data bus to the **MDR** 
        
    - The **PC** is incremented by 1
        
- **Decode**
    
    - The data is sent from the **MDR** to the **CIR** where it is split into the opcode and operand
        
    - This is sent to the **CU** to be decoded
        
- **Execute**
    
    - Which registers are used here will depend on the instruction being executed
        
        - If a value is being inputted (_INP_) the **ACC** will store the value
            
        - If a value is being outputted (_OUT_) this will be the value currently in the **ACC**
            
        - If a value is loaded from RAM (_LDA_) this will be sent across the data bus from RAM (in the address location in the **MAR**) to the **MDR**
            
        - If a value is to be stored (_STA_) it will take the value from the **ACC**, send it to the **MDR** and then send it across the data bus to RAM (to the address location in the **MAR**)
            
        - If a value is being added to or subtracted from another value (_ADD/SUB_) 
            
        - If the LMC code is to branch (_BRA/BRZ/BRP_) the comparison will take place in the **ALU**
            

#### Worked Example

**A program written in the Little Man Computer instruction set is given below.**

      `INP           STA num loop 	LDA total           ADD num           STA total           LDA count           ADD one           STA count           SUB num           BRZ end           BRA loop end   LDA total           OUT           HLT one 	DAT 1 num 	DAT 0 count 	DAT 0 total 	DAT 0`

**Explain which registers are used and their values when the line** `STA count` **is executed and the accumulator is holding the value 9. The label** `count` **refers to** **memory location** **16.**

[2]

**How to answer this question:**

- The instruction being executed in this example is `STA count`, so the registers used will be:
    
    - **ACC -** the accumulator is holding the value "9"
        
    - **MDR -** the value "9" from the **ACC** will be copied to the MDR
        
    - **MAR -** the value 16 will be stored here so the data is sent to memory location 16
        
- The value that’s in the accumulator **(ACC)** is going to be stored in memory (RAM)
    
- To work out where in memory it will be stored we need to know what `count` represents
    
- In this question, we've been told it's **16 -** _"the label_ `count` refers to memory location 16"
    
- You're not always told this in your exam, so you should also be able to count the lines of code
    
- It’s best to write the line numbers on the code in the question, to see which line `count` is on. (Don’t forget that the first line is memory location 0!)
    
- "Count DAT 0 "is on line 16, so the value "16" is what goes to the **MAR** register. (You already know this from the question above)
    
- It is always the value from the accumulator (**ACC**) that is stored, so the value "9" must go to the **MDR** as data can only be sent to memory from the MDR
    
- Then the value is sent to the memory location, in this case 16
    

**Answer:**

 **Example answer that gets full marks:**

The contents of the accumulator (9 in this case) will be copied to the MDR [1 mark] and then 9 is copied to location 16. [1 mark]

**Acceptable answers you could have given instead:**

The value 16 is copied to the MAR.   [1 mark]

#### Examiner Tip

- When answering a question about registers **be specific about the contents of the register** based on the question to make sure you get the marks
    
- If your answer to the question above didn't include the values 16 and 9 then you wouldn't get the marks despite knowing which registers are used. This is because the question is asking you which registers are used **and** their values when the line `STA count` is executed
