[[!1.1 Structure & Function of the Processor]]

## Pipelining

### What is Pipelining?

- Pipelining is the process of carrying out multiple instructions **concurrently**
    
- Each instruction will be at a different stage of the **fetch-decode-execute cycle**
    
- One instruction can be **fetched** while the previous one is being **decoded** and the one before is being **executed**
    
- In the case of a **branch**, the pipeline is flushed
    
- This table shows which stage each instruction is at during each step:
    

||**Fetch**|**Decode**|**Execute**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Step 1|Instruction A|||
|Step 2|Instruction B|Instruction A||
|Step 3|Instruction C|Instruction B|Instruction A|
|Step 4|Instruction D|Instruction C|Instruction B|

- While one instruction is being executed, the next instruction will be decoded and the following instruction will be fetched
    

### How Does Pipelining Improve Processor Performance?

- Pipelining reduces **latency** 
    
- The **CPU is not idle** while waiting for the next instruction which **increases the speed of execution**
    
- The next instruction is fetched while the current one is decoded/executed
    
- All parts of the processor can be used at any instance in **time**
