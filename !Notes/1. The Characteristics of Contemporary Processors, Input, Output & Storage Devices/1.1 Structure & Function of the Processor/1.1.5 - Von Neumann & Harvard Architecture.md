## Von Neumann & Harvard Architecture

### What is Computer Architecture?

- A computer architecture describes how it uses the components and instructions to make the computer function
    
- There are 2 common types of computer architecture:
    
    - Von Neumann architecture
        
    - Harvard architecture
        

|**Architecture**|**Memory Organisation**|**Bus**|**Address Space**|**Control Units**|**Usage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Von Neumann**|Unified Memory|Single|Shared|Single Control Unit|Most modern computers, microcontrollers|
|**Harvard**|Separated Memory|Separate|Distinct|Separate Control Units|Specialized embedded systems|

## Von Neumann Architecture

**Layout of Von Neumann Architecture**

Von Neumann's architecture includes:

- **Control Unit (CU)**
    
    - The control unit controls the operation of the processor and its components
        
    - It retrieves instructions stored in memory, decodes or interprets them, and then executes them
        
    - The CU generates timing signals and controls the other units of the computer
        
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
    
    - The ALU carries out all the arithmetic and logic operations in the computer such as:
        
        - Addition
            
        - Subtraction
            
        - Multiplication
            
        - Division
            
        - Comparisons, etc.
            
- **Special registers** within the CPU
    
- A **single set of buses** to connect the CPU to memory and Input/Output
    
    - These are communication systems that transfer data between the components inside a computer, or between computers
        
    - There are 3 types of buses:
        
        - The data bus carries data
            
        - The address bus carries the addresses where data must be picked up or stored
            
        - The control bus carries signals relating to the control and coordination of all the activities within the computer
            

- **Memory (RAM)**
    
    - The memory unit stores both data and instructions for processing
        
    - These are stored in the same format
        
    - The memory is divided into cells, each of which can be accessed by their address
        
    - The memory is a linear or sequential array of bytes
        

## Harvard Architecture

**Layout of Harvard Architecture**

Harvard architecture includes:

- **Separate Instruction and Data Memory**
    
    - In Harvard architecture, the system has separate memory units for storing data and instructions
        
    - This separation provides greater speed and efficiency as the system can fetch data and instructions simultaneously from separate buses, without one interfering with the other
        
- **Separate Instruction and Data Buses**
    
    - Harvard architecture uses separate buses for data and fetching instructions, meaning that data transfers do not interfere with instruction fetches
        
    - This can lead to better overall system performance
        
- **Control Unit (CU)**
    
    - The control unit controls the operation of the processor and its components
        
    - It retrieves instructions stored in memory, decodes or interprets them, and then executes them
        
    - The CU generates timing signals and controls the other units of the computer
        
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
    
    - The ALU carries out all the arithmetic and logic operations in the computer such as:
        
        - Addition
            
        - Subtraction
            
        - Multiplication
            
        - Division
            
        - Comparisons, etc.
            

### How does Harvard Architecture improve performance over Von Neumann Architecture?

There are several things that Harvard architecture has or can do which can improve performance over Von Neumann architecture:

|**Feature**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|Two separate areas of memory|One for instructions and one for data<br><br>Instructions and data can be accessed concurrently|
|Different sets of buses|One for instructions and one for data<br><br>Instructions and data can be accessed concurrently|
|Pipelining|Whilst an instruction is being executed the next can be decoded and the subsequent one fetched|
|Use of Cache|A small amount of high performance memory which is next to the CPU<br><br>It stores frequently used data and instructions|
|Virtual cores / Hyper-threading|This is where a physical core can act as two virtual cores|
|Multiple Cores|Each core acts as a separate processing unit|
|Onboard Graphics|Built-in circuitry for graphics processing|
|Performance boosting mode|The clock speed can be temporarily increased for a performance boost|
|Out of Order Execution|Instructions can be executed before earlier ones if they are ready|
|Super Scalar|Multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously|

#### Examiner Tip

- You will not be asked about specific aspects of “contemporary processor architecture” apart from those on this page. You may be asked to show an awareness of how contemporary processors differ from a pure Von Neumann architecture in more open questions
