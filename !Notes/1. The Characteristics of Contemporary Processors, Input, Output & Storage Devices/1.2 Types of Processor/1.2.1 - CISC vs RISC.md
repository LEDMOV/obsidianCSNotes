[[!1.2 Types of Processor]]

## CISC & RISC

- A computer processor will have an **instruction set** that it can use to execute programs
    
- This will **vary from one processor to the next**
    
- There are **2 types of processors**:
    
    - Complex Instruction Set Computer 
        
    - Reduced Instruction Set Computer
        

### CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

- **Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)** consists of a **larger instruction set** which includes more complex instructions
    
- As the instructions are more complex, they can **take more than one clock cycle to execute**
    
- Has more **general purpose registers**
    
- Instructions take up **less space in memory**
    
- Is usually used in **laptops and desktop** computers
    

### RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

- **Reduced Instruction Set Computer** consists of a **smaller instruction set** with more simple instructions
    
- Each instruction takes **one clock cycle to execute** which makes it more **suitable for pipelining**
    
- Compilers are more complicated so will **generate more instructions**
    
- Has **fewer addressing modes**
    
- Is usually used in **smartphones and tablets**
    

### What’s the Difference Between RISC & CISC?

||**RISC**|**CISC**|
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|Has fewer transistors|Has more transistors|
|Takes one clock cycle per instruction|Takes multiple clock cycles per instruction|
|Suited to pipelining|Not suited to pipelining|
|Compilers are more complicated|Compilers are less complicated|
|Has fewer general purpose registers|Has more general purpose registers|
|Used in smartphones and tablets|Used in laptops and desktops|
|Has fewer addressing modes|Has more addressing modes|
|**Benefits / Drawbacks**|Requires less power|Requires more power|
|Costs less to manufacture|Costs more to manufacture|
|Takes up more space in memory|Takes up less space in memory|

- A program that has been **written for a RISC** processor **won’t work on a CISC** processor and vice versa
    
- A program that has been **written for a RISC** processor **won’t necessarily work on another RISC** processor as they may have different instruction sets
