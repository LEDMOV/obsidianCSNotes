[[!1.2 Types of Processor]]

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

### What is a GPU?

- A graphics processing unit (GPU) is responsible for **processing graphics** within the computer to **reduce the load on the CPU**
    
- **CPUs are general purpose processors** whereas **GPUs are designed specifically for graphics**
    
- GPUs are likely to have built in circuitry or instructions for common graphics operations
    
- GPUs can perform an instruction on **multiple pieces of data at one time**
    
- This is useful when processing graphics (e.g. transforming points in a polygon or shading pixels) which means it can perform transformations to on screen graphics quicker than a CPU
    
- The GPU can either be **part of the graphics card or embedded in the CPU**
    
- A GPU will usually be [multicore](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/1-the-characteristics-of-contemporary-processors-input-output-and-storage-devices/1-2-types-of-processor/multicore-and-parallel-processors/) and can have up to 76 cores
    

### What can a GPU be used for besides graphics?

Besides graphics processing, a GPU can also be used for:

#### 3D modelling

- The GPU can be used to **render** lighting effects, textures and shadows
    

#### Data modelling

- As GPUs can handle many calculations simultaneously, they can handle large datasets and complex operations like sorting and filtering data
    

#### Financial modelling

- GPUs are used to simulate different scenarios in risk modelling, option pricing and other financial modelling types
    
- Lots of simulations can be run in parallel
    

#### Data Mining

- Data mining is the process of **analysing large amounts of data to find patterns**
    
- The main computational tasks are sorting, searching, pattern recognition, statistical analysis and graph algorithms
    

#### Performing Complex Numerical Calculations

- [Matrix multiplication](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/further-maths_core-pure/edexcel/17/revision-notes/2-matrices/2-1-properties-of-matrices/2-1-1-introduction-to-matrices/) and inversion can be done in parallel
    
- Numerical Simulations
    
    - Physics and engineering simulations often involve solving complex maths models, which can be done in parallel
        
- Solving Differential equations
    
    - Solving differential equations involves computations which can be performed in parallel
        

#### Machine learning

- This involves **training a computer on a massive amount of data** which can be done in parallel. There are lots of matrix multiplications and other computations which can be performed
    
- After the training, GPUs can be used to speed up the process of **making predictions** on new data
    

#### Calculations on multiple data at the same time

- There are a number of scenarios where **calculations will be needed to be carried out on multiple data at the same time** e.g. insurance pricing, modelling risk, calculating bills
    
- This is done by GPUs rather than CPUs due to being set up **for parallel processing**
    

### What types of task are GPUs suited for?

GPUs are suited to certain tasks that utilise:

- **Specialist instructions**
    
    - GPUs are designed to execute specialist instructions which are common in 3D graphics rendering such as operations on matrices, vectors and geometric transformations
        
    - These capabilities have been expanded over time and have been generalised which makes GPUs suitable for a wide range of complex calculations besides graphics processing
        
- **Multiple cores** 
    
    - Although a CPU can have multiple cores, these are optimised for **serial** processing
        
    - GPUs have smaller cores but these are optimised for parallel processing
        
    - GPUs can perform many calculations simultaneously - ideal for tasks that can be broken down into smaller parts
        
    - This is useful in machine learning and situations where large amounts of data need to be processed
        
- **SIMD processing**
    
    - Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processing is computers that have multiple processing elements which perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously
        
    - GPUs support SIMD processing as they were originally designed to perform the same operations on multiple pixels or vertices simultaneously - this is a common requirement in image processing, simulations and machine learning
        

#### Examiner Tip

- You don’t need to know the ins and outs of these uses of GPUs (like how to solve a differential equation) but you need to know what GPUs can be used for besides graphical processing
    

### What are the benefits of using a GPU?

There are a number of benefits to using a GPU as well as a CPU (it isn’t possible to only use a GPU as the CPU assigns tasks to the GPU)

- **[Parallel processing](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/1-the-characteristics-of-contemporary-processors-input-output-and-storage-devices/1-2-types-of-processor/multicore-and-parallel-processors/)**
    
    - GPUs can handle many tasks simultaneously as they are multicore processors
        
- **Speed**
    
    - As GPUs can use parallel processing, this speeds up tasks, particularly those involving large amounts of data or complex computations
        
- **Efficiency**
    
    - GPUs can perform more calculations per unit of power consumed in comparison to CPUs making them more energy efficient when it comes to parallel tasks
