[[!1.2 Types of Processor]]

## Multicore & Parallel Processors

- A multicore system has **more than one processing unit** in a single processor which can **independently process instructions at the same time**
    
- When a computer has multiple cores it can use **parallel processing** where **each core can work on the same task** to complete it more quickly, or **each core can work on separate tasks at the same time**
    
- Parallel processing can also be achieved by utilising more than one processor (a CPU and a GPU)
    

| **Benefits**                                                                                                                                                               | **Limitations**                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Speed**: If a task can be divided into subtasks that can be executed simultaneously, the total execution time can be reduced                                             | **Limit on maximum speed**: Even with an infinite number of processors, there is a limit to the maximum speed improvement that can be made using parallel processing if a part of the program can’t be parallelised |
| **Improved performance**: Simultaneous computation can take place on different data subsets (this would be used in machine learning, data mining and scientific computing) | **Complex programming**: It is harder to write code for parallel processing than serial processing. Tasks have to be synchronised and data shared correctly                                                         |
| **Better resource utilisation**: Parallel processing allows for better use of computer resources as multi-core or multiple processors can be used more effectively         | **Debugging difficulty**: It is more difficult to debug a parallel program than a serial program due to the precise timing of specific events                                                                       |
| **Problem solving**: Problems which are large and complex (which lend themselves to parallel processing) can be solved more easily                                         | **Communication between processors**: Communication between processors can take significant time and resources, potentially outweighing the benefits of using parallel processing                                   |
| **Real-Time applications**: Real-time applications including graphics rendering are more feasible and will benefit significantly                                           | **Limited applicability**: Not all tasks can be run in parallel and must be executed serially                                                                                                                       |

### What are the benefits of using multicore processors?

- **Multitasking**
    
    - Each core can work on a different task - this is particularly effective when the user has multiple applications open at the same time
        
- **Background tasks**
    
    - When using a single core processor, a background task like anti-malware scans can slow down the user's other task. A multi-core processor can assign the background task to one core, to reduce the impact on the other task
        
- **Improved responsiveness**
    
    - If a program becomes unresponsive, it won’t slow the user's computer down as much if they're using multi-core as other cores will continue running their task
