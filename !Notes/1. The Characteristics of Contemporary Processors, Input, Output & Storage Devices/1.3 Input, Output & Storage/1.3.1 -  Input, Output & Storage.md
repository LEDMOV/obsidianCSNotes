### Choosing the right device

When recommending a device for a specific situation, consider the following factors:

- User Needs
    
    - What tasks will the user be performing? A graphic designer might need a graphics tablet, while a data entry clerk might need a keyboard with a number pad
        
- User Skills
    
    - Is the user comfortable with the device? A touch screen might be more intuitive for some users, while others might prefer a mouse and keyboard
        
- Environment
    
    - Where will the device be used? A wireless mouse might be suitable for a clutter-free office, while a wired mouse might be better for a public computer lab to prevent theft
        
- Cost
    
    - Higher-end devices often have more features but are also more expensive. Consider the budget and whether the extra features are worth the cost
        

## Secondary Storage Devices

- Storage devices are hardware components that retain digital data within a computer system
    
- They provide a means of storing, accessing, and retrieving data, which can include software applications, documents, images, videos, and more
    
- There are 3 types of storage:
    
    - **Magnetic**
        
    - **Optical**
        
    - **Flash**
        

|**Type of Storage Device**|**Description**|**Benefits**|**Drawbacks**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Magnetic Storage Devices** (e.g., Hard Disk Drives, Magnetic Tape Drives)|Store data by magnetising particles on a disk or tape.|High storage capacity; relatively low cost per gigabyte; suitable for long-term storage and backup.|Slower read/write speeds compared to other types; susceptible to physical damage; moving parts can wear out over time.|
|**Optical Storage Devices** (e.g., CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs)|Store data using a laser to burn pits into the surface of the disc.|Durable and relatively immune to environmental conditions; easy to transport; suitable for distributing software, music, or movies.|Lower storage capacity compared to other types; slower read/write speeds; can be easily scratched or damaged.|
|**Flash Storage Devices** (e.g., Solid-State Drives, USB Flash Drives)|Store data in flash memory cells.|Fast read/write speeds; no moving parts, so less likely to fail due to physical shock; silent operation.|Higher cost per gigabyte; flash memory cells can wear out after a certain number of write cycles.|

Here are some of the devices commonly used for storage:

|**Name of Device**|**Type of Device**|**Typical Storage Capacity**|**Affordability**|**Portability**|**Durability**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**|Magnetic|500GB - 2TB (consumer-grade)|Low cost per GB|Low (especially for internal HDDs)|Moderate (susceptible to damage from shocks or falls due to moving parts)|
|**Solid-State Drive (SSD)**|Flash|120GB - 4TB (consumer-grade)|High cost per GB|High (especially for external SSDs)|High (no moving parts, less susceptible to physical shock)|
|**USB Flash Drive**|Flash|8GB - 256GB (common sizes)|Moderate cost per GB|Very High (small and lightweight)|Moderate (can withstand casual handling, but can be lost or damaged if not cared for)|
|**CD/DVD/Blu-ray Disc**|Optical|CD: 700MB, DVD: 4.7GB - 9GB, Blu-ray: 25GB - 50GB|Low cost per disc|High (thin and lightweight)|Low (can be scratched or damaged easily)|

###   
Choosing the right storage device

When recommending a storage device for a specific situation, consider the following factors:

- Storage Needs
    
    - How much data does the user need to store? A user with large amounts of data might need a high-capacity HDD, while a user who only needs to store a few documents might be fine with a USB flash drive
        
- Performance Needs
    
    - Does the user need fast access to their data? An SSD might be best for tasks that require high-speed data access, like video editing or gaming
        
- Portability
    
    - Does the user need to transport the data? USB flash drives and external HDDs or SSDs are portable and can be used to transfer data between different computers
        
- Cost
    
    - Higher-capacity and faster storage devices are generally more expensive. Consider the user's budget and whether their storage and performance needs justify the extra cost
        

## Virtual Storage

### What is virtual storage?

- Virtual storage, also known as cloud storage, refers to a model of data storage where digital data is stored across multiple servers and locations, typically hosted by third parties e.g. Microsoft, Google, Apple
    
- While the storage may appear to be local from the user's perspective, the data is physically located elsewhere, often distributed across a network of servers
    

### Why is there a need for virtual storage?

- In the digital age, the amount of data generated and used by businesses and individuals is growing exponentially
    
- Storing all this data on local devices can be impractical due to limitations in storage capacity and the risk of data loss
    
- Virtual storage provides a solution to these challenges by offering scalable, off-site storage with built-in redundancy and backup
    

### How does virtual storage work?

- When you use virtual storage, your data is transmitted over the internet to a data centre
    
- This data centre uses servers to store your data, which can be accessed and retrieved as needed. These servers are maintained by the cloud storage provider, who ensures that the data is secure, backed up, and available for access
    

|**Benefits of Virtual Storage**|**Drawbacks of Virtual Storage**|
|---|---|
|**Scalability**: Easy to increase storage capacity as needs grow.|**Dependence on Internet Connection**: Access to data can be slow or impossible with a poor Internet connection.|
|**Accessibility**: Data can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.|**Security Concerns**: Storing sensitive data off-site can pose a risk, despite the provider's security measures.|
|**Data Protection**: Data redundancy protects against data loss due to hardware failure.|**Ongoing Costs**: While cost-effective, virtual storage is an ongoing expense and costs can add up over time.|
|**Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the storage used, often more affordable than maintaining own storage infrastructure.||

#### Examiner Tip

- Don't get mixed up between virtual storage and virtual memory
    
    - Virtual storage is data which is stored virtually (on the cloud)
        
    - Virtual memory is utilising secondary storage as RAM when the computer is maximizing RAM
