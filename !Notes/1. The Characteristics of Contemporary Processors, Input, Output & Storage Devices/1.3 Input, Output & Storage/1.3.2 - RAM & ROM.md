## RAM & ROM

### What are the Differences between RAM & ROM?

### RAM (Random Access Memory)

- RAM stores data that is currently being used by the computer, such as open applications and files
    
- The data in RAM can be read from and written to by the processor, allowing for fast data access and manipulation
    
- RAM is volatile, which means it loses its contents when the computer is turned off or restarted
    
- It's also directly accessible, meaning the processor can access any part of the RAM equally fast, hence the name "Random Access Memory"
    
- In all types of computers, from desktops to mobile devices to embedded systems, RAM plays a crucial role in the system's speed and performance. The more RAM a system has, the more data it can process simultaneously, leading to faster performance
    

### ROM (Read-Only Memory)

- ROM stores the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or firmware that is used to start up the computer and initialise the hardware components. This data is essential for the computer to function and needs to be preserved even when the computer is turned off
    
- ROM is non-volatile, meaning it retains its contents even when the computer is turned off. As its name suggests, data stored in ROM can be read by the computer but not written to or modified
    
- In all types of computers, ROM is essential for system startup. E.g. in mobile devices, ROM might contain the bootloader that starts the device and loads the operating system
