[[!1.3 Input, Output & Storage]]

**Key Differences: RAM & ROM**

##### Comparing RAM and ROM

|Feature|RAM (Random Access Memory)|ROM (Read-Only Memory)|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Stores data currently being used by the computer.|Stores the BIOS or firmware for system startup.|
|Volatility|Volatile; loses data when power is off.|Non-volatile; retains data when power is off.|

Key Considerations for Device Selection

- **User Needs**: Determine the tasks the user will perform to recommend appropriate devices.
- **User Skills**: Assess the user's comfort level with different devices.
- **Environment**: Consider where the device will be used to choose wired or wireless options.
- **Cost**: Balance the budget with the features needed for the tasks.

Facts to Memorize

- RAM is volatile, meaning it loses data when powered off.
- ROM is non-volatile, retaining data even when powered off.
- Common storage capacities: HDD (500GB - 2TB), SSD (120GB - 4TB), USB Flash Drive (8GB - 256GB).
- Types of input devices include keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, microphone, webcam, scanner, game controller, graphics tablet, biometric devices, barcode reader, and joystick.
- Types of output devices include monitor, printer, speakers, headphones, projector, Braille display, plotter, VR headset, and computer-controlled machinery.

Reference Information

- Input devices allow users to input data into a computer system.
- Output devices present processed data to the user.
- Secondary storage types: Magnetic (HDD), Optical (CD/DVD), Flash (SSD, USB).
- Virtual storage is cloud-based and allows for scalable data storage.

Concept Comparisons

|Feature|RAM (Random Access Memory)|ROM (Read-Only Memory)|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Stores data currently in use|Stores BIOS/firmware for startup|
|Volatility|Volatile|Non-volatile|
|Data Access|Read and write|Read only|
|Speed|Fast access|Slower access|
|Usage|Temporary data storage|Permanent data storage|

Problem-Solving Steps

When choosing the right input/output or storage device, follow these steps:

1. Identify User Needs: Determine what tasks the user will perform.
2. Assess User Skills: Consider the user's comfort level with different devices.
3. Evaluate Environment: Analyze where the device will be used and any constraints.
4. Consider Cost: Balance the budget with the features needed.
5. Make Recommendations: Suggest devices based on the above factors.

Key Terms/Concepts

- **Input Device**: Hardware that allows users to enter data or commands into a computer system.
- **Output Device**: Hardware that receives information from a computer and presents it to the user.
- **Secondary Storage**: Hardware components that retain digital data within a computer system.
- **Virtual Storage**: A model of data storage where digital data is stored across multiple servers, typically hosted by third parties.
