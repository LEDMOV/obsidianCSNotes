## D Type Flip Flops

### What is a D Type Flip Flop?

- A **fundamental component in digital circuits** and **computer memory**
    
- Can be referred to as **Positive Edge Triggered**
    

### Key Features

- Contains **two stable states**, making it a type of bistable circuit
    
- Used to **store** the **state of 1 bit of data**
    
- Changes state on the **edge of the clock pulse**
    

### Components

- Data input (**D**)
    
- Clock input (**CLK**)
    
- Two outputs: **Q** and **NOT(Q)**

**D Type Flip Flip Components**

### Operation

- On the rising edge of the clock pulse:
    
    - If D is **high** (1), Q goes **high** and NOT(Q) goes **low**
        
    - If D is **low** (0), Q goes **low** and NOT(Q) goes **high**
        
- The state of Q holds or "**remembers**" its value until the **next** rising clock edge
    

### Use Cases

- Forms the basis of most types of flip flops and latches
    
- Used in **shift registers**, **counters**, and **memory units**
    
- Helpful in **edge-triggered devices**, **synchronous circuits**, and **data storage**
    

#### Examiner Tip

You will not be asked to recall the logic gates that make up a D-type flip flop and they can be made from various different gates  
They are often built using NAND gates which are AND gates that have their output inverted:

#### Worked Example

- **Draw the output of the Flip Flop on the diagram below**

**D Type Flip Flop Question**

- For a question like this remember that the output line Q that you are asked to draw wants to be the same as the input D BUT it can only change when the clock signal changes from low to high (i.e. at the dotted lines)
    
- At the start assume Q starts the same as D (low in this case)
    
- Then draw it along from left to right until you get to a vertical dotted line (in an exam you would draw these lines on to help you if they weren’t there
    
- At each dotted line, Q has the chance to change to whatever D is

**D Type Flip Flop Working 1**

- So at the first line, D is low so Q stays low
    
- At the second dotted line D has changed to high so now Q can become high

**D Type Flip Flop Working 2**

- Q now stays high until the next rising edge of the clock (the next dotted line) where it gets another chance to change, but here D is still high so Q stays high

- And you continue to do this until you reach the right hand side of the diagram
