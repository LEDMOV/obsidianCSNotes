## Karnaugh Maps

### What is a Karnaugh Map?

- This is a tool that is used for **simplifying Boolean algebra expressions**
    
- It offers a **visual method** of **grouping together expressions** with **common factors**
    
- The format of the map makes it **easy to identify** and **eliminate redundant terms**
    
- They are used in digital logic design, such as simplifying the logic of digital circuits
    

### Steps:

1. **Create the Map**: Each cell in the grid corresponds to a term in the Boolean expression. Fill cells with 1s and 0s corresponding to the output of that term
    
2. **Grouping**: Group the 1s in the grid. Each group must be a rectangle and the size of the group must be a power of 2. A cell can be part of multiple groups
    
3. **Simplifying**: Write down a simplified Boolean expression for each group. The simplified expression for a group consists of the variables that remain constant in all terms in the group
    
4. **Final Expression**: Combine the simplified expressions from each group using OR operations to get the final simplified Boolean expression
    

## Creating Karnaugh Maps

- A Karnaugh Map (**KMap**) can be used to **simplify a Boolean expression** with 2 inputs
    
- Here is an example for the expression **A V B** (**A OR B**)
    

### Step 1

- **Add each variable** starting with **A** at the top and **B** down the side
    
- **Add each possible state** for **A** and **B**

### Step 2

- Take each expression in turn **separated** by the **V** (**OR**)
    
- First look at **A** on it's own
    
- Find **all cells where A is 1**
    
- **Add 1 to the cell**

### Step 3

- **Repeat for B**

### Step 4

- This is now a **completed KMap** for the expression **A V B** (**A OR B**)
    

![step](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-2-35-31-pm.png)

## Simplifying Expressions Using Karnaugh Maps

Simplify **¬A^¬B^C v ¬A^B^¬C v A^¬B^C v A^B** using a KMap.

In this example there will be **3 variables** A,B and C so the empty KMap will look like this:

![empty-k-map](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/empty-k-map.png)

### Step 1:

Split this long term at each **OR** giving 4 smaller expressions (subterms) to add to the table:

- ¬A^¬B^C
    
- ¬A^B^¬C
    
- A^¬B^C
    
- A^B
    

### Step 2: 

- Take the first subterm **¬A^¬B^C**
    
- Put a **1** in the map for **every cell where this term would be TRUE (1)**
    
- So if **A** and **B** were **0** and **C** was **1** this subterm would be **1**
    
- So put a **1** in every cell in the KMap where **A is 0**, **B is 0** and **C is 1**

### Step 3:

- The next subterm is **¬A^B^¬C**
    
- Put a **1** in the KMap where **A is 0**, **B is 1** and **C is 0**
    

![k-map-3](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/k-map-3.png)

### Step 4:

- The next subterm is **A^¬B^C**
    
- Put a **1** in the KMap where **A is 1**, **B is 0** and **C is 1**
    

![k-map-4](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/k-map-4.png)

### Step 5:

- The final subterm is **A^B**
    
- Put a **1** in the KMap where **A is 1** and **B is 1** (2 cells this time)

### Making the groups

- Once you have written the 1s and 0s into your KMap, you can then use this to **simply the expression**
    
- In order to do this, you need to **identify the groups**
    
- This is the **key** to using the Karnaugh map to derive the simplified expression
    
- The aim of making the groups is to
    
    - **Make rectangular groups** 
        
    - **Make groups that are as large as possible**
        
    - **Make groups that contain either 8,4,2 or 1 ones**
        
    - **Groups can overlap** (i.e. some ones can be in multiple groups)
        
    - **The Karnaugh map ‘grid’ wraps round in all directions so the groups can wrap round**
        

### Example grouping

**Group 1:**

So this would be one group.

![k-map-6](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/k-map-6.png)

This group would represent **A** since within this group both C and B change (have zeros and ones) whereas for A all the cells are one.

**Group 2:**

This would be another group (**note the wrapping around**).

![k-map-7](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/k-map-7.png)

This group would represent **¬B** since within this group both A and C change (have zeros and ones) whereas for B all the cells are zero

**Final simplified expression**

- To get the final simplified expression we **OR** the terms representing the two groups together.
    
- So the simplified expression is **A v ¬B**
    

#### Examiner Tip

In questions where you have to use a Karnaugh Map always show the groups by drawing a box/circle round them.

#### Worked Example

**A Boolean expression is entered into a Karnaugh map.**

![k-map-8](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/k-map-8.png)

**How to answer this question:**

![k-map-9](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2023/12/k-map-9.png)

- Looking at the group of 8 in the middle of the map, for all the cells in the group the variable B is always a 1
    
- The 3 other variables change across the group (i.e. for some cells they are 0 and for others they are 1  
    So this group is B
    
- Looking at the other group of 8, for all the cells in this group, C is always 0 but the other 3 variables can be 1 or 0 in this group So this group simplifies to ¬C
    

Answer:

**Answer that gets full marks:**

B v ¬C
