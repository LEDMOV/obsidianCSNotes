## Half Adders

### What is a Half Adder Circuit?

- Basic digital circuit used in computation to perform the **addition** of **two single bit numbers.**
    
- Has **two inputs**, usually labelled as **A** and **B**
    
- Produces **two outputs** labelled **Carry out** (Cout) and **Sum**(s)
    

| **A** | **B** | **C****out** | **S**       |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 0     | 0     | 0            | 0           |
| 0     | 1     | 0            | 1           |
| 1     | 0     | 0            | 1           |
| 1     | 1     | 1            | 0           |
|       |       | **A AND B**  | **A XOR B** |

- Remember that you are **adding together** the **binary numbers** represented by **A and B**
    
- Create the **C****out** **column first** then for each row you can just **add A and B together** and write the **answer in 2 bits** in the **C****out** and **S** columns 
    
    - For example in row 2, A is 0 and B is 1 and 0+1=1, which is 01 in 2 bits (Cout 0 and Sum 1)
        
    - In the last row, A is 1 and B is 1 and 1+1 = 2 which is 10 in 2 bit binary (Cout 1 and Sum 0)
        

### Drawing a Half Adder Circuit

- A half adder circuit has **two inputs**, typically labelled as **A** and **B**, and **two outputs**: the **Sum** (S) and **Carry** (Cout). This circuit can be created using an **XOR gate** for the **Sum output** and an **AND gate** for the **Carry output**
    
- **Label Inputs**:
    
    - Begin by drawing two lines on the left side of your paper or drawing space. Label the top line as '**A**' and the bottom line as '**B**'. These represent your **inputs**
        
- **XOR Gate (Sum)**:
    
    - **Draw an** **XOR gate** (often a shape like a curved 'D' or a shape similar to an OR gate but with an additional curved line on the input side) in the middle of the paper or drawing space. Connect the A and B lines to the two inputs of the **XOR gate** 
        
    - The output from the XOR gate is the '**Sum**'. Draw a line from the output of the **XOR** gate to the right side of your paper and label it as '**S**'
        
- **AND Gate (Carry)**:
    
    - **Draw an** **AND gate** (typically a D-shaped symbol) above the **XOR gate**. Again, connect the A and B lines to the two inputs of the **AND gate**.
        
    - The output from the **AND gate** is the '**Carry**'. Draw a line from the output of the **AND** gate to the right side of your paper and label it as '**C****out**'

**Half Adder Logic Gates**

## Full Adders

- **Extends** the half adder to handle the **addition of three bits**
    
- Has **three inputs**: **A**, **B**, and an input carry (**C****in**)
    
- Produces **two outputs**: carry (**C****out**) and sum (**S**)
    

|**A**|**B**|**C****in**|**C****out**|**S**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|0|0|1|0|1|
|0|1|0|0|1|
|0|1|1|1|0|
|1|0|0|0|1|
|1|0|1|1|0|
|1|1|0|1|0|
|1|1|1|1|1|

- To easily reproduce this **Truth Table**, remember:
    
    - The full adder **adds up three binary inputs** A,B and C
        
    - So the answer can be **0,1,2 or 3**
        
    - For each row, add up A, B and C and the **write the answer as a 2 bit binary number** in the last 2 columns (Cout and Sum)
        
    - For example in row 4,  A=0, B=1 and C=1 - **0+1+1=2** which is **10 in binary**, so **C****out** **is 0 and Sum is 1**
        
    - In the last row,  A=1, B=1 and C=1, **1+1+1=3** which is **11 in binary** so **C****out** **is 1 and Sum is 1**
        

### Operation

- The "Sum" output **provides the XOR** of the inputs A, B, and Cin
    
- The "Carry" output is **TRUE** if at **least two of the inputs** A, B, and Cin are **TRUE**
    

### Drawing a Full Adder Circuit

- A full adder circuit consists of **three inputs**: **A**, **B**, and Carry (**C****in**), and **two outputs**: Sum (**S**) and Carry (**C****out**)
    
- It can be designed using **two half adders** and an **OR gate**.
    
- **Label Inputs**:
    
    - Start by **drawing three lines** on the left side of your paper or drawing space. Label the top line as '**A**', the middle line as '**B'**, and the bottom line as '**C****in**'. These represent your inputs
        
- **First Half Adder**:
    
    - **Draw a half adder** with A and B as inputs. This consists of an **XOR gate** (for the Sum) and an **AND gate** (for the Carry). Label the output of the XOR gate as '**Sum1**' and the output of the AND gate as '**Carry1**'
        
- **Second Half Adder**:
    
    - **Draw a second half adder** underneath the first, using **Sum1** and **C****in** as inputs. Again, it consists of an **XOR gate** (for the Sum) and an **AND gate** (for the Carry). Label the output of the XOR gate as '**S**' (final Sum) and the output of the **AND gate** as '**Carry2**'
        
- **OR Gate**:
    
    - **Draw an OR gate** to the right of the half adders. Connect Carry1 and Carry2 to the inputs of the OR gate. The output of the OR gate is the final Carry (**C****out**)

**Describe how this logic circuit can be adapted to add together two 4-bit binary numbers.**

**4 marks**

**Answer:**

Logic circuit adds together 2 binary digits / half adder

S gives sum, C gives carry

Two half adders can be joined together…

…with an OR gate

to form full adder

4 full adders can be used to add two four bit numbers

Carry out on one joined to carry in on next
