## Graphs

### What is a Graph?

- A graph is a set of vertices/nodes that are connected by edges/pointers. Graphs can be placed into the following categories:
    
- **Directed Graph:** The edges can only be traversed in one direction
    
- **Undirected Graph:** The edges can be traversed in both directions
    
- **Weighted Graph:** A value is attached to each edge
    

Computers are able to process graphs by using either an **adjacency matrix** or an **adjacency list****.** 

The examples below will be illustrated using an adjacency matrix, more information on programming using both matrices and lists is available in section 8.

### Undirected, Unweighted Graph

For unweighted graphs:

- 1 is set when an edge exists between 2 nodes
    
- 0 is set when there is no edge between 2 nodes
    

Below is the adjacency matrix for an undirected, unweighted graph:

For this graph, the names are abbreviated to the first letter.

- The data in an adjacency matrix for an unweighted graph is symmetric
    
- To determine the presence or absence of an edge, you inspect the row (or column) that represents a node. _Example: If you wanted to see if there is an edge between Frogmore and Hartlepool you can look at the cross-section of row 3 (for Frogmore) and column 4 (for Hartlepool)_
    
- You need a method (e.g **Dictionary**) to record which row/column is used for a specific node’s edge data
    
- The data values for the nodes (in this example names of towns) are not stored in the matrix
    

### Directed, Unweighted Graph

Above is the adjacency matrix for a directed, unweighted graph.  
For this graph, the names are abbreviated to the first letter.

- Due to the lack of symmetry in this matrix, you cannot access the data by both row and column, you must know the direction in which the values are stored
    
- _E.g.: In row 0 for Bolton there is only one neighbour (Dunkirk) because there is a single directed edge from Bolton towards Dunkirk. This is because there are 3 edges directed towards Bolton (from Dunkirk, Hartlepool and Frogmore)_
    
- If you are implementing a graph as an adjacency matrix you will need to choose the direction and make sure that the data is stored and accessed correctly
    

### Undirected, Weighted Graph

- For weighted graphs the values of the weights are stored in the adjacency matrix
    
- If an edge does not exist between two nodes, then a very large number (normally the infinity symbol ∞) is set

### The Applications of Graphs

Graphs have many uses in the world of Computer Science, for example:

- Social Networks
    
- Transport Networks
    
- Operating Systems
    

|**Keyword**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|Directed Graph|A directed graph is a set of objects that are connected together, where the edges are directed from one vertex to another.|
|Undirected Graph|An undirected graph is a set of objects that are connected together, where the edges do not have a direction.|
|Weighted Graph|**A weighted graph is a set of objects that are connected together, where a weight is assigned to each edge.**|
|Adjacency Matrix|Also known as the connection matrix is a matrix containing rows and columns which is used to present a simple labelled graph.|
|Adjacency List|**This is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph.**|
|Vertices/Nodes|A vertex (or node) of a graph is one of the objects that are connected.|
|Edges/Arcs|An edge (or arc) is one of the connections between the nodes (or vertices) of the network.|
|Dictionary|A collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project.|

#### Examiner Tip

It is not important what the graph looks like, but which vertices are connected.
