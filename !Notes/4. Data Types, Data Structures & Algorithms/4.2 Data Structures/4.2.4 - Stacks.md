## Stacks

### What is a Stack?

- A **stack** is a last in first out (**LIFO**) data structure
    
- Items can only be added to or removed from the top of the stack
    
- Stacks are key structures in the computing world as they are used to reserve an action, such as go back a page or undo
    
- A real-life example of a stack would be a pile (or stack) of plates at a buffet; you can only take a plate from the top, and if you need to reach the bottom one you have to remove all the others first
    
- It is often implemented using an array
    
- Where the maximum size required is known in advance, static stacks are preferred as they are easier to implement and make more efficient use of memory
    
- A stack has 6 main operations, which can be seen below
    

|**Operation**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**isEmpty()**|This checks is the stack is empty by checking the value of the top pointer|
|**push(value)**|This adds a new value to the end of the list, it will need to check the stack is not full before pushing to the stack.|
|**peek()**|This returns the top value of the stack. First check the stack is not empty by looking at the value of the top pointer.|
|**pop()**|This removes and returns the top value of the stack. This first checks if the stack is not empty by looking at the value of the top pointer.|
|**size()**|Returns the size of the stack|
|**isFull()**|Checks if the stack is full and returns the boolean value, this compares the stack size to the top pointer.|

- Stacks use a **pointer** which points to the top of the stack, where the next piece of data will be added (pushed) or the current piece of data can be removed (popped)

## Adding & Removing Data From a Stack

### Pushing Data to a Stack

- When pushing (adding) data to a stack, the data is pushed to the position of the pointer
    
- Once pushed, the pointer will increment by 1, signifying the top of the stack
    
- Since the stack is a **static data structure**, an attempt to push an item on to a full stack is called a stack overflow
    

#### Visual Example

- This would push Bunny onto the empty stack

- This would push Dog to the top of the stack

- This would push Ant to the top of the stack

### Popping Data From a Stack

- When popping (removing) data from a stack, the data is popped from the position of the pointer
    
- Once popped, the pointer will decrement by 1, to point at the new top of the stack
    
- Since the stack is a static data structure, an attempt to pop an item from an empty stack is called a stack underflow
    

#### Visual Example

- This would pop Ant From the top of the stack. The new top of the stack would become Dog
    

![pop---visual-example](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/01/pop---visual-example.png)

- Note that the data that is ‘popped’ isn’t necessarily erased; the pointer 'top' moves to show that Ant is no longer in the stack and depending on the implementation, Ant can be deleted or replaced with a null value, or left to be overwritten
    

#### Worked Example

**Stacks and queues are both data structures.** 

**A stack is shown below before a set of operations are carried out on it.** 

**Draw what the stack shown below would look like after the following operations:**

**pop(), push(“A”), push(“B”), pop(), push(“E”), push(“F”)**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|Z|
||Y|
||X|

Answer:

- Start by using the operation pop() to remove Z from the top of the stack
    

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|Y|
||X|

- Use the operation push(“A”) to add A to the top of the stack
    

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|A|
||Y|
||X|

- Then use the operation push(“B”) to add B to the top of the stack
    

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|B|
||A|
||Y|
||X|

- Then use pop() to remove the top item in the stack
    

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|A|
||Y|
||X|

- Then use push(“E”) to add E to the top of the stack
    

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|E|
||A|
||Y|
||X|

- Finally use push(“F") to add F to the top of the stack
    

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Pointer|Data|
|→|F|
||E|
||A|
||Y|
||X|

- F at the top of the stack with E directly below it [1]
    
- A,Y,X. directly below E (with no other entries) [1]
