[[!4.1 Data Types]]

## Primitive Data Types

### What are Data Types?

- A data type is a classification of data into groups according to the **kind of data they represent**
    
- Computers use different data types to represent different types of data in a program
    
- The basic data types include:
    
    - **Integer**: used to represent **whole numbers**, either positive or negative
        
        - Examples: 10, -5, 0
            
    - **Real**: used to represent **numbers with a fractional part**, either positive or negative
        
        - Examples: 3.14, -2.5, 0.0
            
    - **Char**: used to represent a **single character** such as a letter, digit or symbol
        
        - Examples: 'a', 'B', '5', '$'
            
    - **String**: used to represent a **sequence of characters**
        
        - Examples: "Hello World", "1234", "@#$%"
            
    - **Boolean**: used to represent **true or false** values
        
        - Examples: True, False
            
- It is important to choose the correct data type for a given situation to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the program
    

### Casting

- Casting is when you convert one data type to another data type
    
- When a user enters data into a program, this will more than likely be in a **string format**
    
- It's essential to convert some of this **string** data to a **numerical format** where possible
    
- For example, you may want to perform **calculations** on age-related data to determine if someone is eligible to vote
    
- Some programming languages can't execute numerical comparisons on text data, making this transformation crucial
    
- For example if you had "12" stored as a string and you wanted to know if this value was below 20
    
- Therefore, the string value of "12" will need to be cast as an integer to allow the comparison to take place
    

### Python example

`int_value = int("123") // converts the string "123" to 123`

`float_value = float("3.14") // converts the string "3.14" to 3.14`

### Java example

`int intValue = Integer.parseInt("123"); // converts the string "123" to 123`

`double doubleValue = Double.parseDouble("3.14"); // converts the string "3.14" to 3.14`

### Casting between data types

|**Conversion**|**Example**|**Output**|
|---|---|---|
|From **Integer** to **Real**|`int_value = 5  real_value = float(int_value)`|`5.0`|
|From **Real** to **Integer**|`real_value = 5.7  int_value = int(real_value)`|`5`|
|From **String** to **Integer**|`int_str = "10"  int_value = int(int_str)`|`10`|
|From **Integer** to **String**|`value = 5  str_value = str(value)`|`"5"`|
|From **Boolean** to **String**|`bool_val = True  str_val = str(bool_val)`|`"True"`|
|From **String** to **Boolean**|`bool_str = "True"  bool_val = bool(bool_str)`|`True`|

#### Worked Example

**You are tasked with designing a program for a bookstore.**

**The program should be able to store each piece of information given in table.** 

|**Book Detail**|**Recommended Data Type**|
|---|---|
|The book's title||
|The number of pages the book has||
|The price of the book||
|Whether the book is currently in stock or not||
|The average rating given by customers which ranges from 1 to 5||

**Complete the table by identifying a suitable data type for each piece of information in the table.**
