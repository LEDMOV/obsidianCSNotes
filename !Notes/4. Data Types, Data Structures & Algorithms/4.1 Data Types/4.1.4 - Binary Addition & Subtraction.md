## Binary Addition

### What is Binary Addition?

- Binary addition involves summing numbers in base-2, which uses only the digits 0 and 1
    
- Like denary addition, start from the rightmost digit and move towards the left
    
- Carrying over occurs when the sum of a column is greater than 1, passing the excess to the next left column

### Overflow Errors

- Overflow occurs when the sum of two binary numbers exceeds the given number of bits
    
- In signed number representations, the leftmost bit often serves as the sign bit; overflow can flip this, incorrectly changing the sign of the result
    
- Overflow generally leads to incorrect or unpredictable results as the extra bits are truncated or wrapped around

## Binary Subtraction

- As well as adding binary numbers, we can also subtract binary numbers
    
- One method of doing this is to use two's complement
    

### Example 1

Subtract 1001 (9) from 0011 (3)

**1. Given numbers**

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Number 1**|1|0|0|1|
|**Number 2**|0|0|1|1|

**2. Two's complement**

- Convert the number to subtract (0011) to its **two's complement**
    
- Invert bits to get **1100**
    
- Add 1 to get **1101**
    

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Number 1**|1|0|0|1|
|**Number 2 (Converted)**|1|1|0|1|

**3. Addition Operation**

- Now add **1001** and **1101**
    
- **1001 + 1101 = (1) 0110 - including an overflow**
    

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Carry**|1|||1||
|**Number 1**||1|0|0|1|
|**Number 2**||1|1|0|1|
|**Addition**|1|0|1|1|0|

**4. Remove Overflow**

- The result is **10110** with overflow
    
- Remove the **overflow bit** to get **0110**
    
- In **two's complement** arithmetic, the **overflow bit** does not contribute to the actual value of the operation but is more of a **by-product** of the method.
