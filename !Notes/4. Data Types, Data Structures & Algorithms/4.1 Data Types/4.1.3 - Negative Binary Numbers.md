## Signed Binary Numbers

### What are Signed Binary Numbers?

- A binary number can be signed or unsigned: 
    
    - **Unsigned** - used to represent positive binary numbers
        
    - **Signed** - used to represent both positive and negative binary numbers
        
- We can use signed binary numbers to represent negative numbers using methods such as:
    
    - Sign & magnitude
        
    - Two's complement
        
- Both of these methods use the **Most Significant Bit (MSB)** to represent whether the number is negative or positive:
    
    - If the **MSB is 0**, the number is **positive**
        
    - If the **MSB is 1**, the number is **negative**
        

## Sign & Magnitude

- Sign & magnitude binary numbers contain a:
    
    - **Sign** - This is when the MSB is used to represent whether the number is negative (1) or positive (0)
        
    - **Magnitude** - This is used to describe the rest of the bits after the MSB

Representing negative binary numbers using sign & magnitude

### Binary to denary example

- To convert a sign & magnitude binary number to denary, you need to:
    
    - Convert the number as normal from binary to denary (as described in [Positive Binary number: Binary to Denary)](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/4-data-types-data-structures-and-algorithms/4-1-data-types/positive-binary-numbers/)
        
    - Apply the MSB at the end of the calculation
        
        - If the **MSB** is 1, the number is **negative**
            
        - If the **MSB** is 0, the number is **positive**

Converting sign & magnitude binary numbers to denary

### Denary to binary example

- To convert a denary number to a sign & magnitude binary number, you need to:
    
    - Identify whether the number is positive or negative
        
    - Convert the number to binary as normal (as described in [Positive Binary Numbers: Denary to Binary](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/4-data-types-data-structures-and-algorithms/4-1-data-types/positive-binary-numbers/))
        
    - If the number is negative, change the MSB to **1** 
        

|**MSB**|**64**|**32**|**16**|**8**|**4**|**2**|**1**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|0|0|0|1|1|1|

- 64 + 4 + 2 + 1 = **71**
    
- Apply a sign of 1 to make **-71**
    
- Therefore the denary number **-71** in binary is **11000111** 
    

### A consequence of using a sign bit

- The MSB purpose changes from representing a value to representing positive or negative
    
- Losing the MSB halves the maximum size of the number that can be stored
    
- However, as a benefit it makes it possible to represent negative numbers

Sign & magnitude number system

#### Worked Example

**Convert the 8-bit sign and magnitude binary number 10001011 to denary.**

**How to answer this question:**

- **Identify the sign bit**: The MSB is 1, so the number is negative
    
- **Isolate the magnitude**: We are left with **0001011** by removing the sign bit
    
- **Convert to denary**: The binary number **0001011** converts to 11 in denary
    
- **Apply the sign**: The MSB was 1, so the number is **-11** in denary
    

Answer:

**Answer that gets full marks**

**10001011** converts to **-11** in denary

## Two's Complement

- Two's complement is a different method for representing negative binary numbers
    
- Calculations on two's complement numbers are less computationally intensive
    

### Method

1. Start with the **absolute value** of the number, in this case 12
    
2. Invert the bits so that all of the 1's become 0's and all of the 0's become 1's
    
3. Add 1

Representing two's complement binary numbers

- The purpose of the **MSB** has changed; it now represents **the negative** **starting point** of the number, and the rest of the **bits** are used to count **upwards** from that number. For example using the binary number from the image above:
    
    - Begin counting at **-16**
        
    - Add 4 to make **-12**
        

- Two's complement has a similar consequence to sign and magnitude as the maximum value of an 8-bit value is halved
    

### Denary to binary example

- To convert the denary number -24 to a two's complement binary number, you need to:
    
    - Convert the number to binary
        

|**-128**|**64**|**32**|**16**|**8**|**4**|**2**|**1**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|

- Invert the bits
    

|**-128**|**64**|**32**|**16**|**8**|**4**|**2**|**1**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|1|0|0|1|1|1|

- Add 1 to the number
    

| **-128** | **64** | **32** | **16** | **8** | **4** | **2** | **1** |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1        | 1      | 1      | 0      | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
