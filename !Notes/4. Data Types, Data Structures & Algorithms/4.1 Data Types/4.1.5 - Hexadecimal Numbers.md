## Representing Hexadecimal Numbers

### What is Hexadecimal?

- It serves as a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values
    
- Another numbering system is **hexadecimal** (base-16)
    
- It consists of 10 numbers (0-9) and 6 letters (A-F)
    

### Why use hexadecimal instead of binary?

- It is more concise as four binary bits (e.g. 1010) can be represented with one hexadecimal character (e.g. A)
    
- It is easier for humans to read and write
    
- it is less prone to error as it is more likely to be communicated correctly
    

### Potential uses of hexadecimal

- It is commonly used for debugging, configuring hardware devices, and in cryptographic algorithms
    
- It also also commonly used to define colours. As there are millions of colours in the visual spectrum that require very large binary numbers to represent them, they can be replaced with shorter hexadecimal values

## Hexadecimal Lookup Table

- The hexadecimal lookup table serves as a quick reference for converting numbers between denary, binary and hexadecimal values
    
- The hexadecimal scale is identical to the denary scale until the tens column is introduced
    
- When the denary scale reaches 10, this is when the hexadecimal scale switches to letters, starting with A
    

|**Denary**|**Binary**|**Hexadecimal**|
|---|---|---|
|0|0000|0|
|1|0001|1|
|2|0010|2|
|3|0011|3|
|4|0100|4|
|5|0101|5|
|6|0110|6|
|7|0111|7|
|8|1000|8|
|9|1001|9|
|10|1010|A|
|11|1011|B|
|12|1100|C|
|13|1101|D|
|14|1110|E|
|15|1111|F|

### Using subscript in number representation

- The subscript in number representation denotes the base of a number
    
- It helps in differentiating between number systems
    
- Common uses:
