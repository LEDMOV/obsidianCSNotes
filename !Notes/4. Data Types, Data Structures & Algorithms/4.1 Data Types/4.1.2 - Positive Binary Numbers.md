## Binary

### What is Binary?

- binary refers to a system of representing information using only two digits: **0** and **1**.
    

### Bits

- A **bit** is the smallest unit of **digital information**, representing either an "off" (0) or an "on" (1) state.

The status of a computer bit being on or off.

### Bytes

- **Bits** are grouped into larger structures to form **bytes** (8 bits), **words**, and **long words**
    
- These **groupings** allow us to represent more **complex information**, like numbers, text, and instructions

### What do the 0s and 1s represent?

- In binary, each level is based on powers of 2
    
- In the **8-bit binary number** below, each of the 8 columns represents values of 2n , e.g.
    
- 20 = 1
    
- 21 = 2
    
- 22 = 4
    
- 23 = 8
    
- 24 = 16
    
- 25 = 32
    
- 26 = 64
    
- 27 = 128

Binary powers of two

### Encoding and representation

- Various encoding schemes, like ASCII for text or JPEG for images, map these binary values to human-readable forms
    
- For example, the binary value 01001000 represents the letter 'H' in ASCII
    
- In the example below, an image is shaded black or white depending on the binary value for each pixel
    
- Each row in the image requires 1 byte of storage

### Abstraction layers

- Computers handle large volumes of basic numeric data
    
- To create meaningful representations of data, layers of abstraction exist so that basic data can be interpreted upwards into other forms, e.g. images, sound, video
    
- The same principle applies to programming languages that compile down into binary code
    
- At the bottom, you have binary, and each layer above it allows for more meaningful information to be represented

## Converting Between Binary & Denary

- Within computer science, two common number systems are:
    
    - **Denary numbers** – This is also known as base-10. These are used by humans and consist of 10 digits ranging from 0 to 9
        
    - **Binary numbers** - Computer systems store data using 1s and 0s. This is known as binary or base-2. Computer systems store data in binary format because computers are made up of circuits and switches that are either on (1) or off (0)
        
- Binary numbers can be converted into denary and vice-versa
    
- For example the 8-bit binary number **01101001** can be converted into denary using the following method:

Binary to decimal conversion

Therefore the 8-bit binary number **01101001** is 105 as a denary value.

## Converting Between Denary & Binary

- To convert the denary number **101** to binary, we firstly write out binary number system
    

|**128**|**64**|**32**|**16**|**8**|**4**|**2**|**1**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||||||||

- Then we start at the left and look for the highest number that is less than or equal to **101** and if so, place a 1 in that column. Otherwise, place a 0 in the column
    
- **128** is bigger than **101** and therefore we place a 0 in that column
    
- **64** is smaller than **101** so we place a 1 in that column. **101 - 64 = 37**. This now means we have **37** left to find
    
- **32** is smaller than **37** so we place a 1 in that column. **37 - 32 = 5**. This now means we have **5** left to find
    
- **16** is bigger than **5** and therefore we place a 0 in that column
    
- **8** is bigger than **5** and therefore we place a 0 in that column
    
- **4** is smaller than **5** so we place a **1** in that column. **5 - 1 = 1**. This now means we have **1** left to find
    
- **2** is bigger than **1** and therefore we place a 0 in that column
    
- **1** is equal to the number we have left so we place a 1 in that column
    
- 64 + 32 + 4 + 1 = **101**. Therefore the denary number **101** in binary is **01100101**
    

|**128**|**64**|**32**|**16**|**8**|**4**|**2**|**1**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|1|
